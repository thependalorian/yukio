## TO	THE	LEARNER

Do	you	like	learning	kanji?	Or	do	you	wish	that	kanji	would	disappear from	the	face	of	the	earth-or	at	least	from	the	Japanese	language? Well,	learning	kanji	can	be	fun, if you	are	motivated.	And	this	kanji book	 was	 created	 to	 motivate	 you,	 with	 practical	 learning	 methods that	really	work,	and	which	will	enable	you	to	enjoy	studying	kanji.

The	 first	 edition	 of 250	 Essential	 Japanese	 Kanji	 Characters Volume	 1 was	 published	 in	 1993,	 and	 Volume	 2	 was	 published	 in 1997.	Since	then,	they've	been	used	by	countless	learners	to	master kanji.	 In	 these	 new	 second	 editions,	 we	 have	 revised	 the	 books	 to include	 all	 the	 410	 kanji	 required	 for	 the	 College	 Board	 Advanced Placement	Japanese	Language	and	Culture	Course	Exam.

## Taking	an	Active	Approach

An	important	 feature	 of	 this	 book	 is	 the	 active	 approach	 it	 takes	 to introducing	kanji.	By	using	authentic	materials,	periodic	quizzes,	and memory	 aids,	 it gradually helps learners acquire the ability to understand	and	use	kanji	in	natural	contexts-that	is,	in	everyday	life.

Another	key	aspect	of 250	Essential	Japanese	Kanji	Characters is the presentation of authentic materials, for instance the actual instructions	 written	 on	 the	 medicine	 envelopes	 you	 might	 receive from	the	doctor	in	 Japan.	 We	 also	 use	 photographs,	 many	 of	 which were	taken	by	our	foreign	students	during	their	adventures	in	Japan. The	kanji	taught	here	are,	clearly,	based	on	everyday	use.

Also,	for	each	kanji	we	include	either	etymologies	or	memory	aids, which	 will	 help	 students	 to	 understand	 and	 memorize	 the	 kanji systematically.	 The	 list	 of	 kanji	 compounds	 will	 also	 help	 learners understand	 how	 new	 words	 are	 created	 by	 combining	 the	 familiar kanji,	and	to	realize	the	power	that	mastering	kanji	offers	them.

Each	lesson	helps	you	master	a	new	group	of	kanji,	and	consists	of several	sections.

-  Introductory	 Quiz introduces	 some	 familiar,	 everyday	 situations where	the	kanji	is	likely	to	be	used.
-  Vocabulary contains	 the	 readings	 and	 meanings	 of	 the	 kanji	 that you've	encountered	in	the	Quiz.
- New Characters teaches you the kanji systematically, by introducing	the	meaning,	the	basic on-kun readings,	the	etymologies or	memory	aids,	and	compound	words.
- Practice will	help	you	improve	your	kanji	reading	and	writing	skills.
-  Advanced	 Placement	 Exam	 Practice	 Question will	 test	 your competence	in	reading	and	writing	semi-authentic	natural	Japanese. These	questions	reflect	the	format	of	the	College	Board's	Japanese Language	and	Culture	examination.

We	wish	to	express	our	gratitude	to	Yūichi	Ikeda,	Kōichi	Maekawa, Michael	Handford,	Su	Di	and	Sandra	Korinchak.

We	 received	 funding	 from	 the	 Japan	 Foundation	 to	 publish	 the original	edition	of	this	book.

The	following	books	were	useful	in	compiling	the	kanji	grids: Reikai Gakushū Kanji Jiten , published by Shōgakkan, and Kanjigen published	by	Gakushū	Kenkyūsha.

We	sincerely	hope	that	this	book	will	help	all	learners-yes,	even	you who	 have	 been	 stymied	 by	 kanji	 before!-begin	 to	 enjoy	 learning kanji.

## INTRODUCTION

This	 book	 contains	 21	 lessons	 introducing	 250	 kanji.	 Each	 lesson focuses	on	an	everyday	situation	in	Japan.

There	is	a	short	explanation	of	kanji	and	kana	before	the	lessons begin.	You	will	also	find	the	Appendices,	the On-Kun Index	and	the Vocabulary	Index	useful	to	refer	to	as	you	learn.

From	Lesson	1	through	Lesson	10,	the	Japanese	is	written	with	a space	 between	 words.	 A	 modified	 Hepburn	 system	 of	 romanization has	been	used.

Each	lesson	is	composed	of	the	following	sections.

1. Introductory	Quiz	This	section	describes	situations	that	you may	encounter	in	daily	life,	and	is	followed	by	a	quiz.	By	referring first	to	the	words	in Vocabulary , you'll	learn	the	readings	and	the meanings	of	the	words	that	are	introduced	in	the	lesson.	And	by solving	the	quiz,	you	will	understand	the	situation	that's	presented. Try	the	quiz	again after the	lesson,	and	you'll	find	out	how	much you	have	learned.
2. Vocabulary	This	section	contains	the	readings	and	meanings of	 the	 words	 used	 in	 the Introductory	 Quiz . Refer	 to	 it	 when studying	 the	 illustrations	 or	 taking	 the	 quiz.	 The	 numeral	 above each	kanji	indicates	the	lesson	where	the	kanji	is	introduced.
3.  New	 Characters	 This	 section	 introduces	 the	 kanji	 of	 the lesson	 using Kanji	 Charts with	 their	 meanings,	 basic on-kun readings,	 stroke	 orders,	 etymologies	 or	 memory-aid	 hints,	 and compounds	with	their	English	translations.

The	 compounds	 essentially	 consist	 of	 newly	 or	 previously

- introduced	kanji.	(Kanji	that	are	not	included	in	the	250	taught	in volume	 1	 are	 marked	 with	 ×.)	 More	 important	 compounds	 are shown	in	the	upper	part	of	the	list.	However,	you	are	encouraged	to study	 those	 in	 the	 lower	 part	 of	 the	 list	 as	 well.	 When	 kana	 is optionally	added	to	kanji	( okurigana ),	 the	 most	 common	 usage	 is adopted	and	formal	usages	are	shown	in	parentheses.
4. Practice	This	section	provides	practice	for	reading	and	writing the	kanji	in	the	upper	part	of	the	kanji	charts.	You	should	use	the practice	 as	 a	 final	 check	 for	 the	 kanji	 learned	 in	 each	 lesson. Answers	to	the	practice	problems	are	not	provided	in	this	book.
5.  Advanced	 Placement	 Exam	 Practice	 Question	 This section	 provides	 an	 exercise	 similar	 in	 format	 to	 the	 College Board's	Advanced	Placement	examination	for	Japanese	Language and	 Culture.	 You	 can	 try	 the	 exercise	 after	 each	 lesson,	 or	 after completing	all	the	lessons.

## UNDERSTANDING	KANJI

The	 oldest	 Chinese	 characters,	 the	 precursors	 of	 kanji,	 originated more	than	3,000	years	ago.	Originally	they	were	simple	illustrations of	objects	and	phenomena	in	everyday	life,	and	developed	as	a	writing tool	mainly	characterized	by	pictography	and	ideography.	Thus	each of	the	Chinese	characters	carries	its	own	meaning	within	itself.

Chinese	characters,	or	kanji,	can	be	classified	according	to	origin and	structure	into	four	categories:

1.  Pictographic	 characters	 are	 derived	 from	 the	 shapes	 of	 concrete objects.

2.  Sign	 characters	 are	 composed	 of	 points	 and	 lines	 that	 express abstract	ideas.

3.  Ideographic	 characters	 are	 composed	 of	 combinations	 of	 other characters.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

4.  Phonetic-ideographic	characters	are	composed	of	combinations	of ideographic	and	phonetic	elements.	Upper	parts	or	righthand	parts often	indicate	the	reading	of	the	kanji.	About	90%	of	all	kanji	fall

into	this	category.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The	Japanese	had	no	writing	symbols	until	kanji	were	introduced	from China	in	the	fifth	century.	Soon	after	this,	kanji	were	simplified	into phonetic	symbols	known	as hiragana and katakana . Thus	the	Japanese language	came	to	be	written	in	combinations	of kanji and kana (see page	9).

This	kanji-kana	writing	system	is	more	effective	than	writing	with kana	 only.	 As	 the	 written	 Japanese	 language	 doesn't	 leave	 spaces between	 words,	 kanji	 among	 kana	 make	 it	 easier	 for	 readers	 to distinguish	units	of	meaning	and	to	understand	the	context.	Readers can	easily	grasp	the	rough	meaning	of	written	text	by	following	kanji only.

Kanji	can	usually	be	read	two	ways.	These	readings	are	referred	to as on-yomi and kun-yomi . On-yomi is	 the	 Japanese	reading	taken	from the	original	Chinese	pronunciation. Kun-yomi is	 the	 pronunciation	 of an	original	Japanese	word	applied	to	a	kanji	according	to	its	meaning. Hiragana added after kun-yomi readings are called okurigana . Okurigana primarily	 indicates	 the	 inflectional	 ending	 of	 a	 kanji, though	 the	 last	 part	 of	 the	 stem	 is	 occasionally	 included	 in	 the okurigana .

Most	kanji	 are	 composed	 of	 two	 or	 more	 elements,	 and	 parts	 of one	 kanji	 are	 often	 found	 in	 different	 combinations	 in	 other	 kanji. Certain	 commonly	 shared	 parts	 are	 called	 radicals,	 or bushu in Japanese.	Radicals	are	used	to	classify	kanji	in	dictionaries;	thus	each kanji	 is	 allocated	 only	 one	 radical.	 Each	 radical	 also	 carries	 a	 core meaning.	 For	 example,	 the	 radical 言 means	 'word'	 or	 'speak.' Therefore	 the	 kanji 語 (language), 話 (speak,	 story), 読 (read), 記 (note	 down),	 and 論 (discuss)	 all	 have	 something	 to	 do	 with	 the meaning	 of 言 . There	 are	 214	 radicals	 altogether.	 These	 are	 some

## frequently	seen	radicals:

4. イ man,	people
5. 言 word,	speak
6. 木 tree
8. 糸 thread
9. 金 metal,	gold
11. 儿 legs
12. 口 mouth
15. 日 sun,	day
16. 門 gate
17. 尸 corpse
19. 宀 roof,	house
20. 十 add,	many

(Note	that	the	radical	listed	above	as	13	is	always	used	at	the	right	of	a character,	 and	 the	 one	 listed	 as	 14	 is	 always	 used	 at	 the	 left	 of	 a character.)

Kanji	strokes	are	written	in	a	fixed	direction	and	order.	There	are several	fundamental	rules	for	writing	the	strokes.

## 1.	Horizontal	strokes:	from	left	to	right


















2. Vertical	or	slanting	strokes:	from	top	to	bottom

3. Hook	strokes:	from	top	left	to	right	or	left	bottom
4. The	center	stroke	first,	followed	by	the	left	and	right	strokes


5. The	outside	strokes	first,	followed	by	the	middle	strokes

6. The	horizontal	stroke	first,	followed	by	the	vertical	stroke	(usually followed	by	another	horizontal	stroke)

7. The	left-hand	slanting	stroke	first,	followed	by	the	right-hand	side

As	your	knowledge	of	kanji	increases,	kanji	dictionaries	become more	helpful.	There	are	three	ways	to	refer	to	a	kanji.

1. Look	for	the	kanji	by	radical	in	the bushu (radical)	index.
2. Look	for	the	kanji	by	stroke	number	in	the kakusū (stroke	number) index.
3. Look	for	the	kanji	by	pronunciation	in	the on-kun reading	index.

## UNDERSTANDING	KANA

## Japanese	Writing	Systems

There	are	four	different	kinds	of	characters	used	for	writing	Japanese: kanji, hiragana, katakana, and romaji (Roman	 alphabet). Kanji incorporates	 meanings	 as	 well	 as	 sounds.	 Hiragana,	 katakana,	 and romaji	 are	 phonetic	 characters	 that	 express	 only	 sounds.	 However, unlike	English,	one	kana	character	can	be	pronounced	only	one	way: 「あ」 or 「ア」 is	only	pronounced	[ a ].

Japanese	sentences	are	usually	written	with	a	combination	of	kanji, hiragana,	 and	 katakana.	 Katakana	 is	 mainly	 used	 for	 foreign	 words that	are	adapted	to	fit	Japanese	pronunciation.	Kanji	appears	in	nouns, verbs,	adjectives,	and	adverbs.	Hiragana	is	primarily	used	to	show	the inflectional	endings	of	kanji	( okurigana ).	 Particles,	 conjunctions,	and interjections	 are	 mostly	 written	 in	 hiragana.	 Although	 hiragana	 can substitute	for	kanji,	a	combination	of	kanji	and	hiragana	is	much	faster to	 read.	 For	 example,	 compare	 these	 four	 ways	 of	 writing	 the	 same information:

Kanji	 and	 hiragana: 私は毎朝早く起きます。	出かける前に テレビを見ます。

Hiragana	 only: わたしはまいあさはやくおきます。	でかけ るまえにテレビをみます。

Romaji: Watashi-wa	maiasa	hayaku	okimasu.	Dekakeru	mae-ni	terebio	mimasu.

English: I	get	up	early	every	morning.	I	watch	TV	before	I	leave home.

## Derivation	of	Kana

Hiragana	 and	 katakana	 are	 Japanese	 phonetic	 syllabaries	 developed from	kanji	in	the	eighth	century.	Hiragana,	which	are	cursive	letters, derive	from	the	shapes	of	entire	kanji	characters.	Katakana,	which	are combinations	 of	 straight	 lines,	 derive	 from	 various	 parts	 of	 kanji characters.	In	some	cases	both	hiragana	and	katakana	are	derived	from the	same	kanji,	such	as to , fu , he , ho , me , and wa , shown	below.	Kana derived	 from	 some	 of	 the	 kanji	 introduced	 in	 this	 textbook	 are	 also shown.

## A	SAMPLE	KANJI	CHART

setsumei sho explanatory


A	sample	from	the	kanji	charts	is	explained	below.

asu/ashita tomorrow


- 1 The	kanji	and	its	serial	number	in	this	textbook.
- 3 Readings: kun -readings	in	hiragana,	and on -readings	in	katakana. Hiragana	following	a	dot	[ ·るい in	the	sample	above]	are okurigana . Readings	in	parentheses	(	)	express	euphonic	change,	i.e.,	modified readings.	 [For	 example, ヒヤク、（ビヤク）、（ピヤク） seen in	kanji	11, 百 . ]
- 5 Etymology or memory-aid. (The authors have created	 new derivations	 for	 some	 kanji	 when	 the	 etymology	 is	 unclear	 or confusing.)
- 6 Important	compound	words,	and	their	readings	and	meanings.
- 7 Additional	compound	words,	and	their	readings	and	meanings.

## Note	that:


-  Kanji	 marked	 ×	 are	 not	 included	 in	 the	 250	 kanji	 taught	 in	 this volume	of Essential	Japanese	Kanji	Characters .
- Kana	in	parentheses	(	)	in	kanji	compounds	is	optional	when	writing. [For	 example, 終（わ）る can	 be	 written 終わる or 終る ].	 Two sets	of	(	)	appear	for	most	nouns	derived	from	compound	verbs.	The kana	in	both	(	)	or	in	the	former	(	)	only	may	be	omitted,	but	the kana	 in	 the	 latter	 (	 )	 alone	 cannot	 be	 omitted.	 [For	 example, 取 （リ）消,	（し） can	 be	 written 取消、 or り消し、取消し、 but	not 取	リ消 . ]
- *	indicates	exceptional	readings.
- Small	numbers	placed	above	certain	kanji	in	the	Vocabulary	sections refer	to	Lesson	numbers	in	this	book.


## Let's	Eat!

## なにか	たべましょう


I n	 Japan,	 as	 in	 many	 other	 countries,	 eating	 out	 is	 a	 popular alternative	to	cooking	at	home.	There	are	a	variety	of	restaurants, with	 the	 most	 popular	 ones	 being soba-ya ( soba shops), shokudō (inexpensiv	 eateries),	 and famirī	 resutoran (family	 restaurants).	 In most shokudō one	 can	 order	 simple	 Japanese,	 Western,	 or	 Chinese meals.	Plastic	models	of	some	of	the	dishes	are	usually	displayed	with prices	 in	 an	 outside	 showcase,	 as	 shown	 in	 the	 picture	 on	 the	 next page.

In	this	lesson	you	will	learn	how	to	write	numerals	in	kanji,	since that's	 how	 they	 are	 written	 in	 restaurant	 menus,	 newspapers,	 books written	vertically,	and	various	other	documents.


## Introductory	Quiz

Look	at	the	illustration	below	and	refer	to	the	words	in Vocabulary . Then	try	the	following	quiz.

In	 a shokudō , you	 will	 often	 find	 the	 names	 and	 prices	 of	 dishes written	on	paper	and	hung	on	the	wall.	Write	the	correct	answers	in the	spaces	provided	below.


- Example: わたしは	そばを	たべました。 450 円でした。 1. プレムさんは	うどんを	たべました。\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_円でした。 2. リーさんは	カレーライスを	たべて、コーヒーを	のみました。 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_円でした。 3. ラーメンは\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_	円です。 4. しょくどうの	でんわばんごうは	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_	です。 5. あなたは	この	しょくどうで	なにを	たべますか。	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_	を	たべます。 6. いくらですか。	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_	円です。

## 何線に	のりますか



I n	 major	 cities	 in	 Japan,	 subways	 are	 the	 primary	 means	 of transportation.	The	map	above	shows	the	subway	lines	and	stations in	Tokyo.	The	lines	and	their	connections	seem	quite	complicated,	but most	 people	 still	 find	 the	 subway	 the	 most	 convenient	 way	 to	 get around.	All	lines	are	marked	with	a	different	color,	and	these	colors are	displayed	on	route	maps	and	signs	in	the	stations	themselves.	The Tokyo	subway	system	consists	of	the	Tokyo	Metro	Lines	and	the	Toei Lines,	and	most	of	these	also	link	up	with	the	JR	(Japan	Railway)	and private	railway	lines.	Subway	stations	are	easy	to	spot,	because	they are	 marked	 with	 big	 signs	 above	 station	 entrances,	 as	 shown	 in	 the photo	above.

In	 this	 lesson	 you'll	 learn	 kanji	 to	 help	 you	 in	 using	 the	 subway system.

## Buying	Tickets

## きっぷを	かいましょう


E xcept	 for	 long-distance	 tickets,	 ordinary	 subway	 and	 railroad tickets	are	valid	only	on	the	day	of	issue.	Coupon	tickets	are	also available	for	about	a	10%	discount.	Since	different	kinds	of	tickets	are required	by	the	Tokyo-Metro,	Toei,	JR,	and	private	lines,	care	should be	taken	to	use	the	proper	vending	machines	in	stations	serving	many lines.	Long-distance	tickets	of	higher	values	are	usually	purchased	at ticket	windows.	At	many	stations,	automated	ticket	gates	are	replacing conventional	ones,	as	seen	in	the	photo	above.


## 1 Introductory	Quiz

Look	at	the	illustrations	below	and	refer	to	the	words	in Vocabulary . Then	try	the	following	quiz.

- I.  Below	 right	 is	 a	 simplified	 route	 map	 of	 the	 Yamanote and Chuo Lines.	The	stations	marked ◎ are	connecting	stations. The	Yamanote	Line	is	a	loop,	and	it	takes	about	an	hour	to	make	a complete	 circle.	 The	 Chuo	 Line	 starts	 from	 Tokyo	 station,	 cuts through	the	center	of	the	Yamanote	Line,	and	goes	as	far	as	Takao, about	50	kilometers	from	its	starting	point.

Study	 the	 fare	 chart	 at	 Shinjuku	 station,	 and	 then	 answer	 the questions.




1. 新 から つぎの 駅までは いくらですか。
- a. しんばし ( )	円
- b. よよぎ ( ) 円
- c. おちゃのみず ( ) 円
- d. なかの ( ) 円
2. 山手線と 中央線の 連絡駅は どれと どれですか。

- II.  Shown	below	are	various	kinds	of	ordinary	tickets	and	a	coupon ticket	for	the	JR	lines,	purchased	at	Shinjuku	station.	The	coupon ticket	is	valid	for	a	specified	journey.	The	child's	ticket	looks	the












same	as	the	adult's	ticket,	but	it	is	 marked	with	a	kanji	meaning 'small'.

Also	 included	 are	 the	 IC	 cards	 'SUICA'	 and	 'PASMO.' SUICA	and	PASMO	are	useful	cards	that	let	the	user	go	through automatic	ticket	gates	with	a	touch	on	the	scanner	at	either	end	of	a journey,	and	calculate	the	appropriate	fare.

Match	the	appropriate	ticket	to	each	statement	below,	and	write the	correct	letters	( a through e )	in	the	spaces	provided.

Insert the ticket

## Campus	Map

## キャンパス・マップ



I ncluding	junior	colleges,	there	are	approximately	1,000	universities in Japan. While mostly concentrated in large cities, some universities	have	recently	moved	their	campuses	into	more	rural	areas, and	 a	 few	 major	 universities	 have	 decentralized	 their	 campuses	 by locating	various	departments	in	different	areas.	Most	campus	facilities include	 libraries,	 co-op	 stores,	 gymnasiums,	 swimming	 pools,	 and


cafeterias, and	 some	 have	 university	 hospitals	 attached	 to their medical	 schools.	 Housing	 for	 faculty,	 staff,	 and	 students,	 however, tends	to	be	very	limited.

## Announcements

## 何のお知らせですか


B ulletin	 boards	 contain	 a	 lot	 of	 useful	 information.	 Campus bulletin	 boards	 offer	 announcements	 like	 dates	 of	 final	 exams, when	new	courses	start,	names	of	scholarship	recipients,	and	so	on. Municipal	offices,	supermarkets,	banks,	and	other	public	places	also use	 bulletin	 boards	 for	 official	 notices	 and	 personal	 advertisements. Thanks	to	ads	on	bulletin	 boards,	 you	 can	 find	 part-time	 jobs,	 used CD	 players,	 or	 bicycles	 at	 discount	 prices.	 Sometimes	 if	 you	 are lucky,	 you	 can	 even	 get	 things	 such	 as	 used	 furniture	 or	 electrical appliances	for	free.	The	community	bulletin	boards	give	you	the	latest news	in	your	neighborhood	and	the	schedules	of	local	events.

In	this	lesson,	you	will	learn	how	to	read	bulletin	boards	and,	in	the process,	you	may	even	find	some	useful	information	on	boards	where you	work	or	study.

W hen	 looking	 for	 a	 place	 to	 live,	 try	 visiting	 a	 real	 estate company	or	looking	over	a	real	estate	rental	magazine.	If	you have	already	chosen	a	location,	it	will	be	helpful	to	visit	a	local	real estate agent in that district. Agents typically hang house	 and



apartment	listings	in	the	window.

Some	 terms	 commonly	 used	 when	 searching	 for	 housing	 are technical	but	important	to	know.	So,	in	this	lesson,	you	will	have	an opportunity	 to	 learn	 some	 kanji	 outside	 of	 the	 250	 basic	 characters taught	in	this	book.


## Introductory	Quiz

Look	at	the	illustrations	below,	and	refer	to	the	words	in Vocabulary . Then	try	the	following	quiz.

A	 real	 estate	 agent	 offers	 information	 on	 two	 apartments,	 A	 and	 B. Compare	the	two	in	detail.	Which	do	you	prefer?	Why?

After	 signing	 a	 contract,	 you	 usually	 pay	 your	 first	 month's	 rent,	 a nominal	administrative	fee,	a	security	deposit	(usually	2	to	3	months' rent),	a	gift	payment	to	the	landlord	(usually	2	to	3	months'	rent),	and an	agent's	fee	(usually	1	month's	rent).

Normal	leases	are	for	a	period	of	two	years,	but	it	is	possible	to leave	before	that	time	by	notifying	the	landlord	and	paying	a	penalty, usually	1	month's	rent.	Contracts	can	be	renewed	after	the	initial	twoyear	period	by	making	another	payment	to	the	landlord,	usually	1	to	2 months'	rent.

"This is the best kanji book available today. Designed for beginners with a basic knowledge of Japanese to use in the classroom or for

## self-study."

- Modern Language Journal

Thoroughly revised to meet the requirements for the College Board Advanced Placement examination. Everyday tasks like finding a street address or buying a train ticket can be an ordeal in

Japan if you don't read kanji-the system of Japanese writing based on Chinese characters. Unfortunately, the kanji characters taught in most textbooks are not always those that you'll encounter in everyday situations. To fill this gap, a group of teachers

from the prestigious University of Tokyo have pooled their talents to create 250 Essential

Japanese Kanji Characters in two volumes: a practical way to learn the kanji most frequently used in daily life in Japan. Each lesson helps you master a new group of kanji, using an extremely effective approach that focuses on you, the learner, taking an active part. · Introductory Quizzes introduce everyday situations where you encounter kanji.

• Vocabulary sections help you understand the readings and meanings of the kanji.

· New Character Charts teach you new kanji systematically-for each character you'll learn its meanings, its basic on-kun readings, its stroke order, common compounds, and derivations.

- Practice sections help you improve your skills in recognizing and using the kanji.
- Advanced Placement Exam Practice Questions for each lesson follow the format of
- the College Board's Japanese Language and Culture examination. You'll also encounter authentic materials such as instructions on a medicine envelope, or
- a rental agency's ad for a Tokyo apartment, that help you understand how kanji are used

in real-life situations.

- By the end of this book, you will have learned 250 of the most important characters in

Japanese and thousands of words in which they appear, and you will be ready for 250 Essential Japanese Kanji Characters, Volume 2, the second book in this acclaimed series.

The Kanji Text Research Group at the University of Tokyo has spent more than two decades focusing on the most effective methods of teaching kanji to new learners of Japanese. The group is based at the University Graduate School of
