## Introduction

Welcome to Marugoto: Japanese Language and Culture, a comprehensive series of coursebooks for adult learners of Japanese as a foreign language developed by the Japan Foundation and based on the JF Standard for Japanese Language Education.

The Japan Foundation engages in a variety of cultural exchange initiatives aimed at deepening understanding of Japan overseas and promoting mutual understanding between Japan and other countries. We think it is important that our work, including our work in Japanese language education, takes place in a way that encourages mutual understanding between people in situations where international cultural exchange takes place, and Marugoto: Japanese Language and Culture is based on this way of thinking.

The word Marugoto means 'whole' or 'everything', and was chosen as the title of the coursebook because the course encompasses both language and culture, features communication between people in a range of situations, and allows you to experience a variety of different aspects of Japanese culture through hundreds of colourful photographs and illustrations.

The coursebook also incorporates many innovative components for learning language including:

- designed for both language performance and language knowledge so that you can communicate more naturally when talking about familiar topics
- designed with an emphasis on understanding and respecting other cultures, and containing situations where people from a variety of cultural backgrounds interact in Japanese
- learning Japanese through listening to a variety of natural contextualized conversations
- management of your own learning through a portfolio approach

We hope that Marugoto: Japanese Language and Culture will motivate you to enjoy learning the Japanese language and Japanese culture, and will help you feel closer to the people who actually live in this culture and speak the language.

## Features of This Book

Marugoto: Japanese Language and Culture is a coursebook that is based on the JF Standard for Japanese Language Education. It has the following features.

## Japanese Levels of the JF Standard for Japanese Language Education

Marugoto employs levels that correspond to the six stages of the JF Standard for Japanese Language Education (A1-C2). Marugoto (Pre-Intermediate) incorporates language activities from both A2 and B1 levels.

## A2 level

- Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment).
- Can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters.

## B1 level

- Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc.
- Can deal with most situations likely to arise whilst travelling in an area where the language is spoken.
- Can produce simple connected text on topics which are familiar or of personal interest. Can describe experiences and events, dreams, hopes and ambitions and briefly give reasons and explanations for opinions and plans.
- Can describe in simple terms aspects of his/her background, immediate environment and matters in areas of immediate need.

## • The Aims of Marugoto Pre-Intermediate

This book has the following two aims:

- 1) To review and extend practice of Marugoto Starter (A1) to Elementary 1/2 (A2)
- 2) To prepare learners for the next level (B1)

Marugoto Starter (A1) and Elementary 1/2 (A2) each consisted of two coursebooks : Katsudoo and Rikai. Pre-intermediate combines both types of study into one book. Cando statements are taken from both A2 and B1 levels, meaning learning is offered through a variety of different classroom activities. In addition, words and sentence patterns are introduced that enrich adult learners' expression of feelings, experiences, and so on.

## • Intercultural Understanding

Marugoto offers learning in both language and culture. There is help with intercultural understanding in various places, such as the situations in which the conversations take place, the contents of the conversations, and the many photographs and illustrations. There are numerous opportunities for you to learn about Japanese culture, reflect on your own culture and deepen your intercultural understanding.

## • Managing Your Own Study

It is very important to evaluate and manage your learning by yourself in order to keep going in language learning. Make a record of the Japanese language and culture you have studied using the portfolio. When you look at your portfolio, you will be able to clearly understand your own learning processes and accomplishments.

## How to Use This Book

## 1 Course Flow

The course using this textbook focuses on communicative language activities and the structural elements of language (grammar and sentence patterns) that support communication.

There are nine topics and one topic is intended to be covered in six to eight hours. There will be two recap sessions entitled 'Test and Reflection' both in the middle and at the end of the course.

## Course example:

## 2 Lesson Flow for Each Topic

## Preparation

· Look at the photos and answer the questions connected with the topic as preparation. · Learn the words and Kanji used in this topic.

## Listen and Talk

Check the Can-do statements for each activity.

<!-- image -->

Listen to four conversations. As well as understanding the contents of each conversation, it is important to grasp the flow of the conversation and notice the expressions that are often used. Listen to the conversations several times.

<!-- image -->

Check the form and meaning of the important sentence patterns you noticed in the conversations, and then discover the rules of language use.

<!-- image -->

Listen to a slightly longer conversation without reading the script, and try to understand the gist of the conversation. Next, read the script, think of expressions that fit the flow of the conversation, and listen again. Listen to the conversation several times.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Speak in pairs or groups using the expressions 8R from the conversations you listened to. The oval bubbles show other expressions you can use. If you cannot do it well, try listening to the conversation again. Audio files for Topic Review (p125-p132) are also available for practice.
