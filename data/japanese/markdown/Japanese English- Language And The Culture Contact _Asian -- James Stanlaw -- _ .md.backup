## Series  editor's preface

The history of European  contact with Japan  starts in the mid-sixteenth  century, when  Spanish  and  Portuguese  explorers  began  to  arrive  in  the  Japanese islands.  These  were  followed  by  the  Dutch  and  English  from  around  1600. From  the  1630s, the  Dutch  came  to dominate  European  contact with Japan, and, over the following  two centuries, Dutch was the only European  language studied  in Japan.  The  study of English  and  other  European  languages  dates from  the  early nineteenth  century,  but  it was not  until  the  Meiji  Restoration of  1868  (following  the  intrusion  of the  United  States in  the  previous  decade) that  the  study  of English  became  widely  established.

Today, the  study of English  in Japan  is an  educational  industry  as well as a national passion, pursued by millions of  Japanese within the public  education system and  in  private language  schools. Despite  the  popularity  of the  English language  in Japan,  however,  the  recognition  of a distinct variety of  Japanese English'  has  long been  problematic.  Many previous studies have  emphasized the  absence  in Japan  of an  identifiably  localized  variety of English  on  a level with  such  other Asian  Englishes  as Indian  English  and  Singaporean  English. Other studies have highlighted those 'monocultural' and  'monolingual'  aspects of Japanese  society that  have  contributed  to a restricted  sociolinguistic  space for  English  in  the  society. At the  same  time, linguists  have  also attempted  to account  for  the voracious  'borrowing'  of tens  of  thousands  of English  words and  phrases  into  the Japanese  language,  notably  (although  not  exclusively) through  the use of the katakana syllabary to incorporate  (and  'nativize')  such items within  the Japanese  language  system. Today it is estimated  that  around five  to  ten  percent  of high-frequency Japanese vocabulary are loanwords  from English,  including  such  items  as biiru ('beer'), terebi ('television'), nyuusu ('news'), karaa ('colour'), supootsu ('sports'), basu ('bus'), rajio ('radio'),  etc. In  modern  Japan,  the  nativization  of  English  has  thus  been crucially accompanied  by an  'Englishization'  of Japanese  that  has crucially  influenced the  dynamics  of contact  linguistics within  society.

James Stanlaw's considerable  achievement in this volume is to unravel  the

complexities  of Japanese  English  with  reference  to  the  history  of  English  in Japan  as  well  as  the  contemporary  dynamics  of  language  contact.  His discussion,  which  includes  much  original  research,  moves  across  a range  of domains  in  contemporary Japanese  society,  including  advertising,  colour nomenclature,  food  packaging,  pop  music,  and  literary  expression.  As  an anthropologist  whose  work  on Japanese  language  and  society  has  spanned three decades, the author brings an interdisciplinary perspective to the  subject which  adds  greatly  to  the  understanding  of  the  unique  characteristics  of  the Japanese  situation. A central  argument  here  is that  the  analysis of  Japanese English'  today  involves  the  recognition  of  a  range  of  English  forms  that constitute  a 'created-in-Japan'  variety of the language, and  that this variety has extended  the range  of the Japanese  language  itself as well as its cognitive  and symbolic systems. This volume  has an  obvious appeal  to anthropologists  and sociologists, but will also serve as an  informative  and  insightful  guide  to  many scholars  in  applied  linguistics,  sociolinguistics  and  cultural  studies  with  a particular  interest  in  world  Englishes  and  the  status, functions,  and  features of English  in Japan.

I  once  said  that finishing  a dissertation  is like getting an Academy Award:  one person  holds  the  Oscar,  but  he  or  she  really represents  the  combined  efforts of many behind  the scenes. I then  went on  for  four  pages  trying to thank  all those who helped me, still not getting everyone. I promise this time to be  more brief, even  though  it is really hard  to know  just where  to begin  in giving credit to people who have helped  me work on  a topic for  over a decade. Of  course, there  are by now probably several  hundred  people  in Japan  who have  kindly given  me  their  time  and  concern.  These  range  from  Higa  Masanori  (my dissertation  Fulbright  advisor  at Tsukuba  University)  to  scores  of  librarians, research assistants, informants,  and just plain friends.  Stephen  Leary and  Keiko Unedaya  start  the  top  of  a very  long  list.  I  have  tried  to  thank  them  each personally, and specifically in previous publications, but I know I have not  done them justice  in  the  past,  and  I know  I cannot  do  any better  now.  But  had  it not  been  for  their  patience  with  a  blundering  -  and  often  illiterate  and inarticulate - foreigner,  I could  never even have begun  to study how English is used  in Japan.

In  the convoluted  progress from  a research  project  to a book, I am  equally indebted. First, Braj Kachru has been  not only my professional  inspiration  and guide, but a true friend  as well. His words of encouragement  and  advice were always what was needed, when  needed.  His faith  in  me  never  let up, in  spite of my many false starts and detours. Kingsley Bolton, the series editor, has also been  simply  terrific,  both  as a critic  and  colleague.  His friendship,  and  very meticulous  care  in  going  over  the  draft  of  the  book,  are  things  for  which  I am truly grateful.  Clara Ho, with her patience, careful  editing, and good  cheer, made  working  with  Hong  Kong  University  Press  a  true  delight.  If  only  all linguistics  scholars  had  such  editing.  Michelle  Woo  and  Susanna  Chow,  Dr Bolton's  assistants, also were very conscientious  in  helping with  graphics  and proofreading.  Three  anonymous  reviewers  carefully  read  the  complete manuscript and gave many valuable comments and criticisms, which  improved the final  arguments  and  presentation.  I also need  to give special  thanks  to Dr

## x Acknowledgements

Yasukata Yano, Professor  of  Linguistics  at Waseda  University, who went  well beyond anyone's possible expectations when reading the manuscript. Not only were his thoughtful  remarks substantive  and  beneficial,  he  also prevented  me from  making an embarrassing number of not only Japanese-language, but also English-language,  mistakes. I thank  them  all very  much.

Anthropologists  have  a  fetish  about  kinship,  and  I  suppose  I  am  no different.  Thus, I have several 'families'  I need  to thank. My initial  professional family  got me started  in  the  right direction  (though  some  now may have  their second  thoughts). In  graduate  school  Cecil  H. Brown  and  Stanley Witkowski introduced  me  to linguistic  anthropology  and  cognitive  science, and Joseph Casagrande,  Rudolph  Troike  and  F. K. Lehman  expanded  my knowledge  in several  important  directions.  David  Plath  taught  me  as much  about  life  and maturity as he did about  Japanese  culture, and  I still every day wonder at  these marvellous lessons. Seiichi Makino - although  he may not want to accept  the blame - gave me my foundations  in Japanese and Japanese linguistics; without his  early  training  I could  never  have begun  the work for  this project.  Finally, I  could  not  have  asked  for  a better  PhD  dissertation  advisor  or  better  friend than Janet  Keller.  I am  certain  that  she  can  supervise  students  much  better now after  all  the  problems  I have caused  her.  Still, as always, my debts  to  her are  large, and  I can  only say Fafetai, Tianit.

My family  at Illinois  State  University  (past  and  present)  show  that  'work' is really not a four-letter word. I am proud  to call fellow anthropologists  Robert Dirks,  Gina  Hunter  de  Bessa,  Martin  Nickels,  Charles  Orser, James  Skibo, Nobuko Adachi, Susan Gillespie, and Linda Giles both friends  and  colleagues. Though  they might not be aware of it, I do listen  to  their  comments, and  their advice  (both  peripheral  and  direct)  has been  of great  help.  My best  friends and Japan-specialist  colleagues  Louis  Perez  and  Roger  Thomas  have  been subjected  to all or part of these materials - either orally or in writing  (of sorts) - literally dozens  of times. The wonderful  thing about friends  such  as  these is that  not  only do  they keep you from  saying stupid  things  (no  mean  task  in my case), they help you to say the occasional smart thing now and  then.  Even though  one  is an  administrator  now,  I cannot  thank  them  both  enough  for their  patience  and  comments,  and  for  their  kind  generosity  in  gladly  taking responsibility for  every one  of the book's failures  and  shortcomings. I also wish to  thank  my chairs  Nick  Maroules  and  Robert  Walsh  who  have  also  offered much  support  (verbally  and  sometimes  otherwise)  at  various  times.  The colleague  who  has  been  the  biggest  help,  however,  is  another  linguistic anthropologist,  Nobuko  Adachi.  It is only because  of  her  modesty  that  her name  does  not  appear  on  this book's  cover.  Her  comments  and  suggestions have been  invaluable, and  I could  not  have written  this book without  her.

My domestic  family  - Betty Stanlaw, John  Stanlaw,  Karen  Stanlaw  and Gilbert Sandgren - have always been there for me in every possible way. Their many sacrifices  for  me  have  often  been  ignored,  but  never  unappreciated.  I

am  not  sure  I can  ever  pay all of  them  back  for  what  they have  done  for  me - or  express  to  them  how  I feel  - but  their  love  has  been  unconditional, even  if often  undeserved.  But once  more,  they must  accept  my IOU.

Deep gratitude  must also go  to my Japanese  extended  family:  Kikuji  and Chieko Adachi,  Kumiko  and  Haruhiko Yamamoto, and  Osamu, Yooko, Jun, and  Mai Adachi. They graciously opened  their  homes  to me, and  offered  me hospitality,  kindness, and  support.  I am flattered  that,  in  spite  of all  common sense  to  the  contrary,  they  took  me  into  their  circle,  letting  me  share  their joys and  sometimes  sorrows with  them.

Finally,  I want  to  tell  my neolocal  family  that  they  have  been  my  source of joy and  confidence  ever since  they came  into  my life.  I cannot  adequately express my feelings  to you - Nobuko, Max and Annie - but someday I hope you can understand  how you have made it all worthwhile  for  me. I thank you from  the  bottom  of my heart  (regardless  of what language  I say this in).

## Prologue

Anyone who  has ever even  had  an  airport  layover  in Tokyo -  or  even  a  cursory exposure  to Japanese  people  -  will  instantly  realize  that  English  in Japan  is like  air:  it  is  everywhere.  It  is  not  clear  if  this  English  is  a  'problem' (Ishino, 1977),  a  'puzzle'  (Yokoi,  1973),  a  'barrier'  to  communication (Hirai,  1978), something  'fashionable'  (Kawasaki,  1981), or  some  kind  of'pollution' (Kirkup, 1971;  Morris,  1970).  But  as  the  commentator  Matsumoto  Toru  (1974: 5)  says, even  a  rudimentary  conversation  in  the  Japanese  language  could  not  be conducted  without  resorting  to  at  least  some  English  linguistic  devices: 1

We, that is, the  Matsumoto  family,  live in a manshon ('mansion')  too. 2 At  this moment, I am watching beisu-booru ('baseball')  on terebi ('television').  My wife is out  shopping  at a depaato ('department  store'), and  later  she will stop at a suupaa ('supermarket')  to  get pooku choppu ('pork  chops'), pan ('bread'), 3 bataa ('butter'), jamu ('jam'),  and  perhaps  some sooseiji ('sausage') for breakfast.  My daughter  has gone  to the byuutii sawn ('beauty  salon')  to get a paama ('permanent').  Oh, the terehon ('telephone')  is ringing. We cannot live a  day in Japan  today without  these  loanwords. Language  purists  lament  the fact.  The  nationalists  would  wipe  out  all  foreign-sounding  words  from  our vocabulary. But where will they be without takushii ('taxi'), terebi ('television'), rajio ('radio'), tabako ('tobacco',  i.e.,  'cigarettes'), biiru ('beer'), shatsu ('shirts'), beruto ('belt'),  and meetoru ('meter')?

According  to Japanese  statistical  surveys,  English  'loanwords'  and  phrases account  for  between  5 and  10 percent  of the  daily  Japanese  vocabulary  (though much  of  this  is not  transparent  to  native  English  speakers).  But what  does  this really  mean?  According  to  the  historian  Louis  Perez  (1998:  4-5), Japan  is  a mental  state  as  much  as  physical  entity:  The  'contrasts  in  the  rhythms  of everyday  life  in Japan  can  boggle  the  mind.  ...Japan  has  a  national  collective respect  for  its  cultural  traditions  almost  unrivaled  in  the  entire  world.  ...  And yet  Japanese  go  to  extraordinary  lengths  to copy and  patronize  Western  culture at  the  expense  of  their  own.'  At  first  glance,  language  seems  to  be  one  more example  of  this.

However, I believe  that  those who dismiss the  use of English  in Japanese as  mere  imitation  are  missing  all  the  dynamics  of  an  important  languagecontact  situation.  This  book,  then,  is an  analysis  of  the  use  of  the  English language  in  modern  Japanese  society.  I  will  try  to  examine  just  why  a supposedly monolingual  and  homogeneous population  not only tolerates  the presence  of  a  foreign language  such  as  English,  but  indeed,  seems  to encourage  it. I will explore  the  many ramifications  this language  and  culture contact  situation  has for  not  only Japanese  themselves, but  also for  others  in the  international  community.  In  order  to  do  that,  I will  examine JapaneseEnglish  language  contact from  an  anthropological  linguistic  perspective,  but, as we will  see,  the  case  of  English  in Japan  is so  subtle  and  sensitive  that  it must be viewed from  numerous  angles.

## Claims

I will make the following dozen arguments throughout  the course of this book:

- that Japanese  today  cannot  adequately  be  spoken  without  the  use  of English  loanwords  or  English-based  vocabulary  items;
- that  English  is  a  creative  -  and  necessary  -  force  in  Japanese sociolinguistics  and  artistic  dynamics;
- that  the  English  used  in Japan  is not  really  borrowed,  as  is  commonly thought, but instead  is motivated  or  'inspired'  by certain  English  speakers or  English  linguistic  forms;  it  is  a  created-in-Japan  variety  for  use  by Japanese  in Japan;
- that  the  presence  of  English  is  hardly  cultural  or  language  pollution (again, as sometimes thought); nor is it a reflection  of a  Japanese  'copycat' mentality;
- that  English  has  a  critical  place  in  the Japanese  symbol  system  -  both public  and  private, linguistic  and  social;
- that  English  loanwords  are  used  by  many  people  -  such  as Japanese women  in  many  circumstances  -  as  a  means  to  circumvent  certain linguistic  and  social  constraints  in  the Japanese  language;
- that  the  presence  of  English  has  affected  Japanese  phonology  and morphology  in very unusual  (and  sometimes  subtle)  ways; I suggest  that the  primary  force  behind  this  mechanism  is  visual,  graphic,  and orthographic,  rather  than  only  auditory;
- that English  plays a very important  role in Japanese  cognitive,  emotional, and  perceptual  processes;
- that Japanese  ideas  of  race  and  national  identity  are  crucially  tied  to lar&gt;guage;
- that,  ironically,  English  plays a critical  role  in  the  reification  of the  sense of self  in Japan;

- that  the Japanese  'loanword'  phenomenon  is a unique  and  special  case, defying  any of the  proposed  sociolinguistic  continuums  used  to  describe such  situations;
- that  the Japanese  case also demonstrates  certain  universal  features  found in  all  places  where  languages  and  cultures  meet,  and  in  that  sense,  has much  to contribute  to a general  theory of language  and  culture  contact.

## Theoretical  perspectives

Along with these various claims, I will focus on four  major  theoretical  linguistic and  social  issues:

- the  place  of  the Japanese  English  case  in  the  larger  context  of  'W^orld Englishes';
- the place of the Japanese  English  case in a general  theory of language  and culture  contact  (processes  of  nativization,  pragmatics,  language  change, communicative  strategies, the interrelationships  of language  and  culture);
- how  the Japanese  English  case  informs  problems  of  categorization, meaning construction,  and  cognition;
- what  the Japanese  English  case  says  about  the  social  construction  of identity  and  sense  of self,  nationalism,  and  race.

Data for  this book has been gathered  off and on for the past decade, using anthropological  ethnographic  fieldwork,  augmented  by  archival  sources, written  materials, and  items from  popular  culture  and  the  mass media. As an anthropological  linguist  by  training,  I,  of  course,  am  informed  by  the sociolinguistic  literature,  and  examine  much  of  the  data  through  this  lens. However, also being a cognitive anthropologist,  I also want to incorporate  the approaches  of  cognitive  science  and  symbolic  anthropology  with the approaches  of sociolinguistics  and  linguistic  anthropology.  My intent  here  is to  take a truly interdisciplinary  approach  in  this exploration  of language  and culture  contact  in Japan.

## Caveats: What  this book  is  not

There  have  been  a few  other  studies  of  borrowing  and  language  contact  in Japan  (e.g., Haarman,  1989; Loveday,  1996) . 4 However,  previous works  have not  looked  at  English-Japanese  language  contact  the  way I do  here,  from  a cognitive,  symbolic,  semiotic,  and  ethnographic  framework.  Apart  from  the formal  processes  of  phonological,  morphological,  and grammatical nativization,  I  take  a  much  broader  approach  by  also  looking  at  music, orthography,  colour  nomenclature,  poetry, food,  race  and  national  identity.

4

Also,  aside  from  topical  differences,  I  bring  an  anthropological  approach to t h e  p r o b l e m  of  English  language  contact  in Japan.  I  should  say  at  the  onset that  I -  unlike  some  other  authors  -  do not believe  that  the  English  used  in Japan  is actually borrowed per  se; most  'English'  found  in Japan  -  to  my  mind at  least  -  is  created  in J a p a n  for Japanese  purposes.  Thus,  I  do  not  spend t o o  much  time  trying  to  place  various  pieces  of  discourse  into  'clines  of acceptability'  or  'scales  of  assimilation',  or  attempt  to  place Japanese  varieties of  English  in  some  framework  of  code-switching/code-mixing  or  other  such typologies.  I  do  not  necessarily  disagree  with  such  analyses,  but  I believe  that t he  language  contact  situation  merits  study  in  other  ways.

## Preview

In  Chapter  2  ('The  dynamics  of  English  words  in  con temporary Japanese'),  I will  introduce  the  role  of  English  and  English  loanwords  in  modern  Japanese. I  will  give  statistics  showing  that  up  to  10  percent  of  the  daily  vocabulary  in Japanese  is English-based.  I will  show  that  the  whole  notion  of  'loanword'  is misleading,  as  many  of  these  so-called  English  words  are  actually  made  in Japan,  for  Japanese  purposes.  I  will  also  show  that  native  English  speakers might  be  hard  pressed  to  identify  many  of  the  common  Japanese-Englishinspired  vocabulary  items  used  in  everyday  life.  My students,  for  example,  are always  fascinated  when  they  find  out  that  'baby  car'  is  actually  a  stroller,  or t hat  a  'virgin  road'  is  the  aisle  a  bride  walks  down  at  a  wedding  ceremony.

In  this  chapter,  I will  also  give  a  sociolinguistic  and  grammatical  overview of  the  use  of  English  in  Japan.  I  will  address  how  English  words  become phonologically  nativized,  and  how  they  are  incorporated  into  the  Japanese morphological  and  syntactical  systems.  I will  also  explain  how  English  can  be used  by  Japanese  people  for  a variety of social purposes,  in  a variety of  contexts and  rhetorical  registers.  I claim  that  in  sociolinguistic  theory Japanese  English occupies  a  unique  place,  being  neither  simply  on  a  cline  of  proficiency nor any  other  commonly  proposed  continuum.  That  is, Japan  is  certainly  not  a country  where  everyone  is  bilingual,  nor  is  there  more  than  one official l a n g u a g e .  Everyone  in Japan  has some d e g r e e  of  c o m m a n d  of some k i n d of English,  but  not  in  the  traditional  sense  that  'fluent'  or  'borrowing'  is  usually used.  Here  I will show some  ways that  English  is incorporated  into  the Japanese symbol  systems, both  private  and  public  (say, using  English  for beautiful human life when  applying  toiletries).  I  will  also  take  up  several  of  the perceived ' p r o b l e m s '  of  English  loanwords,  such  as  intelligibility,  and  what  constitutes an  English  loanword.  The  semantics  of  English  loanwords  in Japanese  will  be discussed,  as will  be  some  theoretical  issues  in  the  sociolinguistics  of  language contact  (relations  of  form  and  content,  loan  shifts,  loan  blends,  and  others).

In  Chapter  3  ('The  history  of Japanese  English  language  contact'),  I will

describe  the  meeting  of English  and Japanese  in  historical  perspective.  I will show that, contrary to popular belief, English has been used in Japan  ever since the first contact with  British  and Americans. Borrowing has been  taking  place for  well  over  a  century,  although  in  rather  different  forms.  I will  argue  that some of this contact, including the development of several 'pidgins' at  different periods.  I will  examine  the  growth  of English  borrowing  in  the  Taishoo  and early  Shoowa  'roaring  twenties',  and  see  how  the  government (rather unsuccessfully)  tried  to  repress  English  during  the  Second  World  War.  I will also describe  the language contact situation during the American  Occupation, and  discuss  the  status of current Japanese  English  language  contacts.

In  Chapter  4  ('The Japanese  writing  system  and  English'),  I will  discuss the Japanese  writing  system  and  the  effect  English  has  had  on  it.  As  the Japanese  use a separate  script to write foreign  names  and  places, the  effect  of orthography on borrowing - as well as the effect  of borrowing on  orthography - is hardly trivial. I will show how the pronunciations of English words become nativized  when  taken  into Japanese.  Here,  however,  I will demonstrate  how the  presence  of  English  has actually  modified  the Japanese  writing system  as well.  For  instance,  several  dozen  new Japanese  'letters'  have  recently  been developed  for  writing some  of the  borrowed  English  sounds  more  accurately (that  is, accurate  in  terms  of what  is believed  to be  closer  to a native  English speaker's  pronunciation).  In  other words, this attempt  to approximate  some of the  English  sounds not present in Japanese, for  better or worse, has  forever changed  native Japanese  phonology.  The  implications  of  these  orthographic and  phonological  changes will be  discussed  here.

The  next  two chapters  discuss  the  influence  of English  in Japanese  and poetics - particularly music and verse. In Chapter  5  ('The  poetics of English in Japanese  pop  songs and  contemporary  verse'),  I will discuss some  aspects of Japanese  contemporary  popular  music. I do so in  order  to show - in  this chapter  and  the  next - the  role  of English  loanwords  in Japanese  song  and verse.  For  instance,  I have  claimed  that  probably  75 percent  or  more  of  all the  (native Japanese  language)  song  titles  in  the Japanese  hit  parade  have English  loanwords  in  their  titles  (Stanlaw,  1990b)  - for  example, Sapphire no Kugatsu no Yuugata ('The  Sapphire  of the Dusk of September'). Inoue  Hisashi (1981: 244-55)  believes that it is even higher. I argue that  Japanese  pop music, with  all  its  use  of  English,  is not just  a  poor  attempt  to  mimic  American  or British  rock; instead,  I believe  that it is a means  to express Japanese  concerns in a  Japanese voice. Many of these same claims can also be applied  to Japanese verse. Apart from  presenting other cases of lyricists and songwriters, I will show how English  now pervades much  of  Japanese poetry, even its traditional  forms. For  example,  I argue  that  the  'Tawara  Machi  phenomenon'  of  the  1990s the instant success and tremendous popularity of an average young high  school teacher  writing  poems  in  the  classical tanka form  - was due  in  large  part  to her creative and  humorous use of English loanwords. Even traditionalists, such

as the new critically acclaimed haiku poet Mayuzumi Madoka, are using English loanwords  in  artistic  and  imaginative  ways  (earning  the  begrudging  approval of  the  poetic  orthodoxy).

However,  the  most  important  discussion,  I  feel,  centres  around  how English  influences  women  in  the  arts  in Japan.  In  Chapter  6  ('A  new voice: The use of English as a new rhetoric in modern Japanese women's  language'), I will  show  how  many  sophisticated Japanese  female  singers  and  songwriters are using English  to explore issues that are socially and artistically very  difficult (if  not  impossible)  for  them  to  do  in  the Japanese  language.  For  instance, Takeuchi  Mariya in one  of her  more  famous  tunes directly asks her  boyfriend in  the  song  to marry her  (using the  usual  English  phrase). It is doubtful  such sentiments would be expressed so directly to a man by a Japanese woman  using Japanese.  The  implications  of  this  'new voice'  or  new  rhetoric  for  Japanese women  - that  is, using  'English'  loanwords  or  English-inspired  vocabulary items - are  explored  in  this  chapter.

In  Chapter  7  ('Using  the  graphic  and  pictorial  image  to explore Japan's "Empire  of Signs" '), I will extend  the  orthographic  examinations  in  Chapter 4.  Many  influential  semioticians  and  critics  (such  as  Roland  Barthes)  have called Japan  a vast  'Empire  of Signs'. In  this chapter,  I will show that  the  use of  English  is  hardly  restricted  to  spoken  mediums.  Billboards,  T-shirts, television  commercials, and  hundreds  of everyday articles  (from  book bags  to name brands)  use English  extensively in some form  or other.  I claim  that  the variety of scripts  used  in Japan  allow for  some very visually exciting  (or  often intentionally  humorous)  uses of  English.

In  the  next  two  chapters,  I will  focus  on  cognition  and  the  senses.  In Chapter  8  (Ts  it naisu rice  or  good gohari?'), I  will  look  at  English  in  the Japanese  palate. It indeed  seems that in Japan,  'it is not what you eat, but  how you say it', at least some of the  time. For example, whether something is 'Naisu (nice)  Rice'  or  'Good Gohan (rice)'  depends  on  a  complex  interaction  of several  linguistic  and  pragmatic variables, including venue, physical dish,  and perceived  type  of  food.  In  this  chapter,  I will  explore  the  use  of  English loanwords  in  the  realm  of  taste,  particularly  in  the  area  of  fast  foods  and packaged  snacks,  where  the  use  of  English  names  or  terms  is  almost compulsory.  I claim  that  English  is used  not just  to give these  products  some chic Western  mystique  or  glamour, but  instead  is used  in  highly creative  and useful  ways. Indeed,  it appears  that  certain  flavours  or  tastes  are  inspired  by some  of these  English  loanwords.

In  Chapter  9  ('Language  and  culture  contact  in  the Japanese  colour nomenclature  system'),  I will  show  that  the Japanese  colour  system  actually consists  of  two groups  of  terms;  that  is, a set  of  native Japanese  words  and  a set of English loanword  equivalents. I will argue that in some cases the English loanwords are actually replacing  the  native Japanese  ones  (e.g., orange,  pink, and  grey)  as  shown  in  saliency  tests  and  colour  mapping  tasks.  I  suggest,

however,  that  many  times the  native  terms  and  loanwords  are  affectively  and cognitively  different,  rather  than just  being  mere  substitute  labels  for  each other.

In  Chapter  10 ('Sense,  sensation, and  symbols'), I will discuss  perception, culture,  and  language  in Japan,  elaborating  some  of  the  points  made  in  the previous  two chapters. I claim  that  there  is a strong  relationship  between  the senses and many English loanwords, articulating off certain  'basic' stimuli  (such as pure or  'fire-engine'  red). I will also argue that for  non-dominant  sensations (such  as ambiguous  tastes or  colours) Japanese  speakers  often  create  English terms themselves to describe them  (e.g., a grey purple colour, or a dry ice candy). This  use  of  English  in  the  face  of  uncertainty  appears  to  be  prevalent  in  a number  of sensory  domains.

I  will  conclude  some  of  the  discussions  started  in  previous  chapters  by focusing  on  language  change.  'We don't  say the city anymore,'  explained  one informant  as she told me some of the newer ways of referring  to Tokyo. Certain English  loanwords in Japan  are remarkably robust, while others only have halflives  comparable  to  physics'  most  exotic  elements.  In  this  chapter,  I will examine some of the ways that English  loanwords in Japan  have changed  over time.

However,  lexemes  and  grammatical  forms  alone  do  not  tell  the  whole story;  the  relationships  between  language  change  and  culture  change  need be addressed.  Here, I will discuss the processes of how symbols might  change in  a  language/culture.  I argue  that  a very  common  way symbols  are  being altered  in Japan  is by 'symbolic  innovation',  where  a new sign  is created  and a  new  set  of  attributes  applied  to  it.  (This  is  opposed  to  other  devices  of symbolic  change,  such  as  'symbol  replacement',  where  old  symbols  became redefined  with new meanings.)  English loanwords seem to be some of the most common  candidates for  this type of  innovation.

In  Chapter  11  ('Images  of  race  and  identity  in Japanese  and  American language  and  culture  contact'), I will discuss the attitudes  that both Japanese and  Americans  have  had  about  the  mutual  superiority  or  inferiority  of  their languages. A century ago, some high Japanese government  officials  advocated abolishing  their  language  in favour  of English, as Japanese  'would  be  of  little use  outside  the  islands'. Today, however,  in  spite  of  borrowing  thousands  of English  vocabulary  items, there  is a new Japanese  linguistic  self-confidence. However,  I will  point  out  that  the  conflation  of  race,  language,  and  culture which  seems embedded  in some of the rhetoric  of  Japanese  nationalism  gives us reason  for  caution.

Finally,  in  Chapter  12  (Japan,  English,  and  W 7 orld  Englishes'),  I  will address  the  question  of what  'kind'  of English  is the  variety found  in Japan? Although  it is not  an  official  or  auxiliary language, Japanese  today cannot  be spoken  without  English. Yet,  many  -  if  not  most  -Japanese  claim  little fluency  in  the  language  in spite  of some  six to  ten  years of schooling  in  it.  In

this chapter,  I will discuss both  'English  as an Asian language'  and  'English  as a Japanese  language'.  I will also  discuss  the  issues  of English  hegemony  in  a Japanese  (and  world)  context.

In  this  last  chapter,  I will also  make  summary  and  concluding  remarks. I will connect  the  use of English  in Japan  to other  language  contact  situations, and  address some of the similarities and  differences.  However, for  a variety of reasons  (such  as the peculiarities  of the Japanese writing system, the  extensive teaching  of written  English  grammar  in  the Japanese  schools,  the Japanese curiosity about  the West, and  the  long history of USJapan  culture  contact)  I believe  this  situation  is  unique.  I  suggest  that  the  appropriate  question  we should  ask is not why Japanese  borrow so much  English, but rather, why don't we  find  even  more  of those  mysteries we call  'English  loanwords'  in Japan?

In  terms  of audience,  I am  assuming  that  many readers  of this book will be fellow linguists, anthropologists, sociologists, cognitive scientists, and  others interested  in  language  contact,  sociolinguistics,  and  categorization.  I  hope, however,  that  this  book  will  also  appeal  to  scholars  and  students  in  applied linguistics, such  as those  specializing  in  English  as an  international  language, or  Asian  Englishes.  I  am  hoping,  too,  that  my  non-linguist  Asian  Studies colleagues will  find  much  of interest  here. If nothing  else, I hope  to show my many friends  in Japanese  history, ethnography,  and  literature  that the  'puzzle of  Japanese  English language contact' - as I have often  called it at  conferences - is an  important  and  significant  area  of  investigation  that  merits  closer scrutiny.  However,  that  said,  I hope  many others  might  become  as  intrigued by this  language  contact  problem  as I have  been.  I have  always tried  to write for  the  interested  non-specialist whenever possible  (although  my students have often  begged  to  differ).  I believe,  though,  that  readers who  are  interested  in Japan,  or  those  who  are Japanese  language  teachers  or  students,  or  others studying  popular  culture  -Japanese  or  otherwise  - might  find  much  of interest  in  this book  (while admitting  that some  technical  portions  might  not be  as appealing  as other  parts).

## Significance  of  the  book

WHiile many  nations  of  the  world,  such  as India  or  some  of  the  countries  of western  Europe, are certainly more bilingual m English  than Japan,  none  finds such an extensive presence of English within their native language itself. Indeed, there  is  no  non-Anglophone  nation  where  English  is so  pervasive.  Various suggestions have been  made  to account for  this phenomenon:  English  is chic and  prestigious; American  popular  media  have  penetrated  and  permanently altered Japanese  culture; the Japanese  have a penchant for  borrowing  foreign things; modern  technology and  the information  age have forced  the Japanese to re-evaluate  the  place of their language  in  the world. People  also argue  that

especially  since  the  Second  World  W 7 ar -  with  the  changing  roles  and  place of  individuals  in Japan  -  language,  culture,  and  society  have  changed  forever.

All  these  points  are  valid  in  some  ways  and  to  some  degree,  but  none, even  in  combination,  tells  the  whole  story.  The  uses  of  English  in  Japanese are  extremely  varied  and  often  quite  subtle;  a  sophisticated  and multifaceted way  of  looking at t h i s p h e n o m e n o n is t h u s r e q u i r e d , i n c o r p o r a t i n g methodologies  and  theories  from  not  only  linguistics  and  anthropology,  but also  semiotics,  cognitive  science,  poetics,  and  visual  literacy.  In  this  book,  I hope  to  make  a  first  such  attempt.

The Japanese  case also offers  great general  theoretical  interest  in  a  number of  fields,  in  particular,  worldwide  English,  language  and  culture  contact,  and semantics  and  cognition.

First,  'World  Englishes'  is  now  a  well-studied  subject,  but Japan offers something  that  is different  from  other  language  and  culture  contact  situations. Japan  was  never  an  Anglophone  colony  (with  the  possible  exception  of  the seven-year  postwar  American  occupation).  Still,  the  presence  of  the  English language  is extraordinarily  voluminous,  which  is rather  unusual  for  a  country where  English  was  never  official  or  imposed.

Second,  as is well  known  to all linguists  and  anthropologists,  there  are  very few  truly  homogeneous  and  monolingual  societies  in  the  world.  Most  speech communities  are  quite  multilingual,  and  language  contact  is a matter  of  course. A  few  places,  such  as Japan  (while  never  as  homogeneous  and  monolingual contact  situations  in  multilingual  societies. Thus, Japan  has  much  to  say  about a  theory  of  language  contact  that  goes  beyond  continuums  of  community as  commonly  thought),  offer  an  interesting  counterexample  to  languagebilingualism  or  degrees  of  intelligibility.

Finally,  the  presence  of  English  in Japan  has  some  important  insights  to offer  on  how  people  construct,  apprehend,  and  perceive  the  world. Why is  it, for  example,  that  all Japanese  people  have  available  to  them  not  only  their native Japanese  number  or  colour  terms, but  also complete  sets of basic  English terms?  Do Japanese  and  English  terms  label  different  categories?  Are t h e English  terms  used  merely  as  synonyms?  Do  they  carry  different  symbolic  or connotative  messages?  Are  they  used  in  different  communicative  strategies? Do people  think  about  the  world  differently  when  using  them?  How  do  people acquire  the  meanings  of  these  English  words  and  phrases  (many  of which  are constructed  right  on  the  spot)?  What  are  the  'right'  meanings  if many  of  the sociolinguistic  rules  allow for  extreme  individual  creativity?  W^hat processes  of semantic  negotiation,  then,  are  taking  place  when Japanese  people  use  these forms?  In  other  words,  when Japanese  people  use  English,  how  should  they sound?  'American-ly'?,  Japanese-ly'?  (Baxter,  1980),  or  something  completely different?  While  I admit  that  I am  not  able  to  offer  the  final  word  on  all  these ambitious  questions,  I hope  that  the Japanese  data  presented  in  this  book  give some  intriguing  first  answers.

## The  dynamics of English words in contemporary Japanese: Japanese English and  a  'beautiful human life 9

## Introduction 1

His demeanour  and  his Sony company pin indicated  that he was an  executive who  could  make  people  sit  up  and  listen  when  he  spoke. I was listening  to him,  too, albeit sitting two seats away on  the  bullet  train Green  Coach heading for  Kyoto.  'We  import  too  many  of  them  from  the Americans,'  he  declared authoritatively, eliciting nods of agreement from  his two travelling companions. 'If you want  to know what I think,  that's my opinion!'  'And why can't we stop this  invasion?'  added  the  one  seated  across  from  him,  'We're  really  at  their mercy.'  I  wondered  just  what  they  were  talking  about.  What  were  these mysterious American  imports  that seemed  to demoralize  these veteran  Sony bureaucrats  so  much?  After  another  five  minutes  of  listening  to  their conversation,  the  source  of their  anxiety was revealed, when  I finally  realized (with  a  mixture  of  interest  and  guilt)  that  they were  actually  lamenting  the large number of English words that were being incorporated  into the  everyday Japanese  language.

If words were an  item  of trade, the Japanese  economy would  be  facing  a deep  crisis. While  Americans  have  imported Japanese  cars, computers,  and electronic  goods  in  huge  numbers,  only a few Japanese  words  have  entered the vocabulary of most Americans, cultural  items like geisha,  karate, and sumoo, or  such  food  items  as sukiyaki,  sashimi, and sushi. The  sad  truth  is that  most Americans' knowledge of  Japanese barely goes beyond the brand  name of their latest  camera,  VCR,  or  stereo.  In Japan,  on  the  other  hand,  the  number  of words  imported  from  English (typically  American  English) is  simply astonishing. These include such  everyday items as terebi for  'television', tabako ('tobacco')  for  cigarettes, as well as myriads of baseball  terms  (e.g. hoomu ran ' home  run'  or sutoraiku 'strike');  many  of  which  reflect  the  importation  of related  aspects  of Western  culture.  In  addition,  however,  many  other  items are  uniquely Japanese  in  their  provenance,  and  might  more  accurately  be regarded  as  'made-in-Japan'  creations.  This  domestically-created  Japanese

English  vocabulary  is notable  for  a wordstock  comprising  many  items  which have  no  real  equivalents  in  US or  British  English.  Examples  of  these  include kyanpingu  kaa ('camping  car')  for  recreational  vehicles, raibu  hausu ('live house')  for coffee  shops or  jazz clubs with live music, or afutaa kea ('after  care') for  product  maintenance.

Estimates  of  the  number  of  'loanwords'  in  daily use  in  modern Japanese range  from around  three  to  five  thousand terms,  which represents approximately  5 to  10 percent  of ordinary daily vocabulary as shown  in  Table 2.1. 2

However,  not  all  loans  are  created  equal.  As Table  2.2  shows,  the  vast majority  of  loanwords  in  newspapers  are  derived  from  English,  while  words from  other  European  languages  tend  to be  reserved  for  restricted  purposes. 3 For example, most of the Italian loanwords in Table 2.2 deal with music; while German  has  contributed  many  medical  terms.  French  loanwords  are  often associated  with  high  culture, whereas  many words of Russian  origin  came  in during  the  political  upheavals  of  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth century. As we will see  in  the  next  chapter,  Dutch,  Portuguese,  and  Spanish loanwords came into the language before Japan  opened  its doors to the West in  the  1850s. The  distribution  of loanwords  also varies according  to  context, as  Table  2.3  below  illustrates.  The  left-hand  column  shows  the  top  twenty loanwords  as  found  in  a  general  newspaper  survey,  while  the  right-hand column  displays  a list  of  loanwords  that  are  salient  in  the  texts  of  women's magazines. 4

Loanword  dictionaries  of  all  types and  sizes are  popular  in Japan,  with the  latest  edition  of  the  largest  containing  over  27,000  entries  (Arakawa, 1977). 5 Each  year  some  publishers  distribute  linguistic  yearbooks  and almanacs  reflecting  the  state  of  the  language, which  list  the  new  loanwords that  have appeared  during  the  previous year. English loanwords are  pervasive in Japan,  and  can  be  heard  in  daily  conversation,  on  television  and  radio programmes,  or  seen  in  books  and  magazines  of  all  kinds.  Specialized technical journals  also use substantial  numbers  of loanwords. English  terms (usually written  in  roman  letters)  are almost compulsory  on  personal  articles such  as T-shirts,  purses,  men's  gym  equipment  or  other  kinds  of  tote  bags, jackets,  or  sweaters. There  is sometimes  a transparent  connection  between the  loanword  and  the  labelled  object,  such  as champion or head coach on  a sweatshirt  or  tracksuit,  or  a university  logo  on  a sweater. At other  times,  the associations are cloudy. Once I saw a T-shirt with fifty  lines of an  encyclopedia entry  on  the  state  of  Georgia  copied  verbatim,  listing  its  major  industries and  cash  crops.  Not  infrequently,  a suggestive  or  blatantly  obscene  phrase is  written  on  a  garment,  the  force  of  which  presumably  is  unknown or ignored  by  the  wearer.  I  once  saw  a  young  girl  probably  no  more  than thirteen  years  old  wearing  a T-shirt  that  said Baby do you  want  to do it! She was shopping with her  mother,  and yet no one around  her seemed  offended or  shocked.

## Japanese  English  in  daily  life

Explaining  the  pervasiveness  of English  loanwords  to the  casual  observer  of Japanese  society is no  easy task. 6 On  my first  trip  to Japan,  I was surprised  to find  that  there  were  two  words  for  rice  commonly  used  in  the  language: gohan, the  traditional Japanese  term, and raisu, an  English  loanword  that  has been  phonologically nativized. I found  it curious that an  English word  would be borrowed  for  something  so basic to life  in Japan  as the  main  staple  food. The  word gohan itself  can  actually  mean  meal  ('breakfast', ' l u n c h ' , or ' d i n n e r ' ) .  As  an  anthropologist  with  a  background  in  sociolinguistics,  I suspected  that there were various motivations for  this, and several possibilities immediately  came  to  mind.

First,  I  considered  the  possibility  that raisu was only used  when  dealing with foreigners,  but then I noticed from  the media that  Japanese people would use the word when no foreigners were present, and I could easily find  the  term written in newspapers and magazines. My second hypothesis was that raisu was used for  'foreign'  dishes such as karee raisu, i.e.,  'curry rice', and  that for  more traditional Japanese  dishes, one would use gohan, as in kuri gohan ('chestnuts and  rice')  or tori gohan ('chicken  and  rice'). I found  that  this was often  true, but  that  there were a number  of exceptions, and  the  term raisu was also  used

for  many domestic dishes in  certain  restaurants. My third  hypothesis was that the  choice  of  term  would  vary  according  to  type  of  restaurant.  Traditional gohan, while  more  modern  or  Western  types  of  restaurants  (labelled  using  an Again,  there  was a  tendency

Japanese-style  restaurants  (often  referred  to as shokudoo) would  serve English  loanword resutoran) would  serve raisu. for  this  to  be  the  case,  but  this  tendency  was not  uniformly  consistent.

I finally  thought  I had  solved  the  problem  when  I noticed  that gohan was served  in  a traditional Japanese  ricebowl (chawan) while rai5wwas served  on  a flat  plate.  However,  a billboard  in  Toohoku,  an  area  of Japan  not  noted  for  a high  degree  of Western  acculturation,  refuted  this hypothesis. An  older  man was shown  wearing  a yukata (traditional Japanese  informal  robe)  holding  a chawan and  smilingly saying, l Naisu  raisu? ('nice  rice'). Although  this was just an  advertising  technique,  it  does  indicate  that  people  in  their  homes  do sometimes  put raisu in  a  bowl  or gohan on  a  plate.  In  the  last  analysis,  it appeared  that the  tendencies for  naming rice that I had  observed were simply that; heuristic  tendencies  rather  than  any hard  and  fast rules. My observations of  such  food-naming  practices  suggested  that  many  speakers  were  totally unconcerned  about  such  things, and  there  were  few situations  where  it was completely  wrong  to  use  either  term.  Yet  at  the  same  time,  the  subject  of loanwords  is a volatile  one  in Japan.  Whenever  the  topic  is discussed,  there are usually anxieties voiced  about  the  'pollution'  of the  language, or  the  'loss of traditional values', or  (from  some Westerners)  'the copycat mentality of  the Japanese', etc. As my research  proceeded,  I discovered  that  the use of English loanwords  was a  touchstone  for  a  range  of  social  and  political  anxieties,  a number  of which  I discuss  throughout  this volume.

Many  loanwords  are  transparent ' p h o n e t i c l o a n s ' (i.e. direct transliterations)  as in jiinzu ('bluejeans'), basu ('bus'), koohii ('coffee'), kuuraa ('cooler',  or  'air-conditioner'),  or apaato ('apartment'). 7 Other  'loanwords' refer  to objects  or  phenomena  that are  particularly or uniquely Japanese.  For example, gooruden uiiku ('Golden  Week')  means  the  traditional  week-long series  of  holidays  starting  with  the  Shoowa  Emperor's  birthday  on  29 April, including  Constitution  Day on  3 May, and  ending  on  Children's  Day, 5 May. 8 Similarly, many other  loanwords  have only a blurred  resemblance  to items  in other  varieties  of  English,  and  it is not  unusual  for  the  English  loanword  to take on a restricted  meaning in comparison with that of the American  English equivalent.  For  example,  the Japanese  English  word kanningu ('cunning') generally  designates  cunning  in  an  examination  (i.e.  'cheating'). Sutoraiki ('strike')  refers  only to a walkout or labour  dispute  and  has none  of the  other more  basic meanings  associated  the  item  in  British  or American  English.

Metaphors  based  on  English  enter Japanese,  but  the  loanwords  used  to symbolize  them  are  often  different  from  those  in  other  varieties  of  English. For  example,  a  'spaghetti  western'  becomes makaroni  uesutan ('macaroni western'), while a dokutaa sutoppu ('doctor  stop')  is a prohibition  on  certain

activities  under  doctor's  advice  (e.g. Dokutaa  sutoppu  de kinen-chuu nan  da! ' I ' m  not  smoking  because  of  my doctor's  orders!'). Paapurin ('purpling') refers  to young people  making a nuisance  of themselves, and  is derived  from the fashion  of teenage  motorcycle gangs wearing purple scarves. The  recently de-nationalized Japanese  National Railways had  a  very  successful tourist promotion  with  a Discover Japan slogan.  In  1983  they  started another campaign, Naisu  Midii  Pasu ('Nice  Midi Pass'), geared  to encourage  middleaged (midii) career  women  to  take  their  nice (naisu) vacations  on  the National  Railways,  using  special  open  tickets (pasu) that  allow  rail  travel anywhere  in Japan.  Another  example  is  the  use of  pinku-firumu or pinku muubii ' pink  film'  or  'pink  movie'  for  'blue  movie'  (such  metaphors  are sometimes  ignored,  and  the  term fakku eiga 'fuck  film'  is  also  sometimes used).

Japanese  English  words, just  like  native  terms,  can  carry  a  variety  of meanings. Hotto ('hot')  refers  to warm  beverages, and  going to a coffee  shop and  saying hotto kudasai ('Hot,  please')  will get you  a cup  of  hot  coffee.  Also heard,  however, are the latest hotto nyuusu ('hot  news')  or hotto-na wadai ('hot topic').  And  there  is also  the  term hotto-na kappuru ('hot  couple'),  which  is used  by the  media  to  refer  to celebrity  couples  from  the  film  and  pop  music worlds. Some observers have claimed  much  of the  English  now polluting  the Japanese  language  has been  spread  by the  advertising  industry,  and  it is  true that  advertisements  across all media  use English words extensively. These  are found  in  such  product  names  as Cattle-Boutique (leather  goods  shop), White and  White (toothpaste),  and Mirny Fish (cat food),  and  some  loanwords  have even  morphed  into generic  names, such as shaa-pen (or shaapu-pen or shaapupen  shiru) for  ' mechanical  pencil' (from ' Eversharp'),  or kurakushon ('automobile  horn',  from  'Klaxon').

Even  local  stores  may use  English  names  for  eye-catching  purposes.  For example,  one  store  in  the  shopping  mall  at  the  Yokohama  railway  station displays  the  name, It's  DEMO. TO  uninitiated observer,  this  might be understood  as  'it  is  a  demo',  perhaps  a  store  where  new  products  are demonstrated.  But  if  the  name  is pronounced  with  a  'nativized'  Japanese pronunciation,  it  then  becomes itsu-demo, the Japanese  word  for  'always', which  is entirely  appropriate  for  the  actual  function  of  the  shop,  a  24-hour convenience  store  that  is  always  open.  Nevertheless,  the  claim that advertising  is the  prime  cause  of  the  spread  of English  throughout Japanese culture  and  language  is patently  false.  In  fact,  as I shall  show  in  Chapter  3, there  is  a  long  history  of  linguistic  contact  and  borrowing  from  Western languages which  stretches  back  at  least four  hundred  years. If anything,  the ubiquity  of  English  words  in  contemporary Japanese  advertising  is as  much a  reflection  of  their  increasing  use  in  contemporary Japan  as  a  cause  of their  popularity.

One  very  real  source  for  English  words  and  the  English  language

generally  is the  education  system.  The  teaching  of  English  in Japan  is  both compulsory  and  extensive,  with  almost  all  high  schools  providing  English instruction  in  a  system  that  employs  around  60,000  English teachers nationwide. 9 According  to policies  established  by the  Ministry of  Education, all  middle  school  students,  and  most  senior  high  school  students,  are required  to  study  a foreign  language  and  usually  this  is English. Almost  all middle  school  students  begin  studying  English  in  the  seventh  grade,  about 70  percent  of  high  school  students  continue  studying  English,  as  do  100 percent  of  university  students  (English  is a  required  subject  for  all  college and  university  students).  Students  who  plan  on  entering  a  university  are required  to take  an  examination  in English, and  many students  spend  much of  their  preparation  time  studying  English  in jukus (private  cramming schools).

Although  English  is taught  as a foreign  language  throughout  the  school system,  English  in  the  form  of  'loanwords',  or  in  the  form  of  English neologisms  'created  in Japan',  receives  no  official  sanction  in Japan.  The Ministry  of  Education  has  regularly  expressed  dismay  concerning  the  vast amount  of borrowing  from  English  that  occurs  in Japanese.  Ironically,  while members of the Japanese  government  express official  anxiety about  the issue, actual language use within  the Japanese  civil service suggests Japanese  English words are  as widely used  as in  the  private  sector.

## Japanese  English  as a linguistic  resource

English  'loanwords'  and  other  English  words  in Japanese  do  not  simply  add foreign  spice  to an  otherwise jaded  indigenous  linguistic  palate. 10 Like  other linguistic  resources, they are used  in  the communicative  strategies of Japanese people  to achieve  a variety of sociolinguistic  ends, and  to accomplish  certain goals when speaking or writing. These may be as mundane  as trying to impress a  member  of  the  opposite  sex,  or  as  subtle  as  rephrasing  a  potentially embarrassing  question.

For  example,  many Japanese  English  words  carry  connotations  of  the speaker  or  topic  being  modern,  Western,  chic,  or  sophisticated,  which  may indeed  contribute  to  the  popularity  of  English  words  in  advertisements  and in  the  broadcast  media.  Radio  and  television  programmes  use  them continually, and a very high proportion  of contemporary pop songs use English loanwords  in  the  text  or  title: for  example, Rabu  izu  oobaa ('Love  is  over'), Esukareeshon ('Escalation'), Koi wa samaa fiiringu ('Love  is a summer  feeling'), and Tengoku no kissu ('Heaven's  kiss'). In  1981 Tanaka Yasuo's best-selling  first novel Nantonaku  Kurisutaru 'Somehow  Crystal'  contained  what was  perceived as a  'hip'  glossary  of over forty  pages  of  notes, mostly explaining  the  English words  used  in  the  text.

Some English loanwords seem to reflect  changing Japanese  attitudes  and priorities. For example, many commentators  have suggested  that the  English loanword  possessive  pronoun mai ('my') apparently  is  indicative  of  the challenge  of  individualism  to  the  collective  group.  Examples  include maihoomu ('my  home'), mai-peesu ('my  pace'), mai-puraibashii ('my  privacy'),  and mai-kaa-zoku (the  'my  car'  tribe,  or  those  who  own  their  own  cars).  In  the media  this  prefix  is found  on  a vast  array  of  products  and  advertisements: my juice,  my pack,  my summer,  my girl calendar. One  explanation  is  that  it  is difficult  to  express  the  individualism  of the  contemporary  world  (in  contrast to  the  collectivist  notions  of  moral  probity  associated  with traditional Japanese  society)  in  'pure'Japanese  without  sounding  offensive.  It has  been claimed  that  native  terms for  'my'  (e.g. watashi no) or  'self (e.g. jibun) tend to  sound  selfish,  and  that  it  may  be  easier  to  use  an  English  word  in expressing  one's  independence,  because  it  does  not  carry  the  same connotations. Similarly, it has been  commented  that when it comes to matters of the  heart  and  romance, one  is able  to use English with a greater  ease  than the  native Japanese  terms. For example, the modern Japanese  habit of  taking a  girl  to  a  movie,  or  to  dinner,  or  to  a coffee  shop  is described  as deeto sum, doing  'a  date'.

For  some  perhaps,  English  words  appear  less  threatening  than  their Japanese  equivalents, e.g. mensu instead  of gekkei for  'menstruation'; masu for 'masturbation',  or reepu rather  than gookan for  'rape'.  Numerous  informants have  told  me  that  the  English  word  is less  loaded  than  the  native Japanese term,  although  Wilkerson  (1998)  tellingly  argues  that  this  is not  always  the case.  English  loanwords  may  also  serve  to  excite  or  titillate,  rather  than defusing  a loaded  term. This seems to be especially true in the genre of  men's comics, where various activities are routinely described using a brutally explicit variety of English  sexual slang. The  availability of English  loanwords  may also provide  speakers with  a means  of circumventing  other  linguistic  and  cultural constraints.  For  example,  the  loans hazu ('husband')  and waifu ('wife')  may convey  a  lighter  symbolic  load  than  the  native  Japanese  terms shujin ('husband',  'master')  or kanai ('wife'  literally,  meaning  'the  one  inside  the house').  Members  of  the Japanese  National  Debating  Team  told  me  a  few years  ago  that  debates  were  almost  impossible  to  conduct  in  Japanese, especially  for  women.  To  their  knowledge,  all  these  societies  in  Japan conduct  their  contests  in  English.

Finally,  another  reason  for  the  use  of  English  words  in Japanese  is  that individuals  apparently  feel  free  to  use  them  in  creative  and  highly  personal ways. For example, one Japanese linguist  (Shibata, 1975) describes how a movie scriptwriter  invented  new loanwords  thus:

In  the script  I found  the expression  'flower  street.'  I then  asked  the  script writer what it meant and where he picked up the expression. The reply was: 'I just  made it up myself.' I was subsequently told  that the meaning had to

do with the decoration of flowers, a decoration movement that was going on at the time. I no longer recall the exact meaning, but there can be no mistake thatjapanized  'English,' such as happy end ox flower street, was introduced into the Japanese lexicon by people ...  in a more or less similar fashion.  (Shibata,

1975: 170)

In  my own  research  on Japanese  colour  terminology  (which  I discuss  in Chapter 9), I often  found  informants  'creating'  their own colour names  using English loanwords  (such as peeru paapuru 'pale  purple', or howaito buruu 'white blue').  Tanaka,  the  author  of the  novel  mentioned  earlier,  also explains  that he  invented  the  term kurisutaru ('crystal')  to  describe  the  attitudes  of  today's Japanese  youth. According  to Tanaka,  'crystal  lets you  see  things  through  a cloudy  reflection',  and  today's  crystal  generation judge  people  shallowly,  by external  appearances,  and  by 'what  they wear and  acquire'  (Tanaka,  1981).

The issue of the intrusion  of English words into  the Japanese  language is a  sensitive  topic  in  contemporary Japan,  and  discussions  of  the  issue  in academic  writings  and  the  print  media  often  invoke  appeals  to  notions  of cultural  superiority  and  inferiority,  national  and  self-identity,  and  a range  of other  social  and  political  issues  (as  we  will  see  in  Chapter  11).  Not  only Japanese  commentators, but also American  and  other  foreign  observers  have condemned  the use of loanwords. At the same time, among linguists and  other academics,  there  seem  to be  at least  three  broad  approaches  to  the  analysis of English vocabulary in Japanese: first,  the  'loanword'  approach; second,  the 'English-inspired  vocabulary  item'  approach;  and,  third,  the  'made-in-Japan English' (wa-sei eigo) approach.

The loanword approach asserts that it is impossible to detach  the  'Englishness'  of  borrowed  terms  from  their  source,  and  therefore the  label  of ' l oanword'  is  an  appropriate  one.  In  this  view,  such  items  are  essentially 'foreign',  which  is  a  major  source  of  their  attraction  in  the  first  instance. Proponents  of  this view would  tend  to  deny  that  these  items  are  ever  fully nativized.  Although  some  might  argue  that  many  English  words  are  fully integrated  into  the Japanese  cultural  and  linguistic  systems, the  advocates  of the  loanword  approach  deny  this.  Their  contention  is  the  importation  of Western  concepts  and words carries with  it a cultural  payload.  For  example, the  use  of  the  English  loans hazu ('husband')  and waifu ('wife')  mentioned above  carry  with  them  a  range  of  connotations,  e.g.  modern  attitudes  to marriage,  greater  equality  between  the  sexes,  the  changing  role  of motherhood,  etc.  In  this view words  are  not  simply  the  building  blocks  of communication,  but  are  the  transmitters  of  culture,  in  this  case,  a  foreign culture.  In  other  words, English  loanwords are English  and are loanwords.

The  English-inspired  vocabulary  item  approach  argues  that,  in  many instances  of  contemporary  linguistic  contact,  English  loanwords  are  not really  loanwords  at  all,  as  there  is  no  actual  borrowing  that  occurs. 'Borrowing'  is thus an  inappropriate  metaphor,  as, in many cases, nothing  is

ever received, and  nothing  is ever returned.  The  limitations  of this  metaphor are  illustrated  by  the  loanword  test  given  at  the  end  of  this  chapter.  Unless the  reader  is familiar  with  the Japanese  language  and Japanese  culture,  she will  probably  flunk  the  test  (see  pp.  37-42).  As the  answer  key  to  the  quiz explains, most of these so-called  'English'  terms are simply not  transparent  to non-Japanese  speakers of English; they are  terms made  in Japan  for Japanese consumption.

Perhaps a more  accurate way of referring  to such items would be to  label these  'English-inspired  vocabulary  items'.  A word  in  English  may  act  as  a motivation for  the formation  of some phonological  symbol, and  or  conceptual unit,  in Japanese; but  no  established  English  lexeme  is ever really  transferred from  the  donor  language  (English)  to  the  recipient  language  (Japanese). Instead,  new words are  created within  the Japanese  language  system by using English.  Often  there  may be a conceptual  and  linguistic  overlap between  the new term and the original English word, but many such instances often  involve radical semantic modifications.  In  this view then, English words are  essentially Japanese  items, and  their  use  in Japanese  may be very different  from  their use  in  other  varieties  of  English.

The  third  perspective,  the  'made-in-Japan  English' (or wa-sei eigo) approach,  is actually a stronger version  of the  second  approach.  In  this view, one that I tend to subscribe to myself, the argument is that most of the English words found  in Japanese  today are  'home-grown',  and  are  items of Japanesemade English or wa-sei eigo, as the translated  term reads in the Japanese  original (Miller,  1997; Ishitoya,  1987; Abe, 1990; Yamada,  1995). One argument  against this  view  is  that  many  of  the  English  words  that  are  used  in Japan,  in newspapers,  television,  academic  writing, etc., appear  to retain  their  original meanings  and  their  written  forms  at  least  are  indistinguishable from corresponding  items in other varieties of English  (as opposed  to their  spoken forms  which  are  invariably modified  to match  the  norms  of  Japanese  English phonology). One  difficulty  in  responding  to this argument  directly is that  no accurate  figures  are  available  to distinguish  'normal'  English  loanwords  from wa-sei eigo loanwords, for a number of reasons, not least because of the  difficulty in  distinguishing  'type'  from  'token'  in  this  context  (where  type  refers  to distinct  words,  and  token  to  related  items).  For  example,  the 2001 September  11 attacks  on  the  World  Trade  Center  added teroru ('terrorism') to the language alongside the previously extant tero. These terms are not exactly equivalent,  as tero is a  noun  and teroru can  be  a verb,  and  seems  to  permit  a wider  range  of  usage  than tero. For  example, tero-teroru! ('That's  terrorism,  I tell  you!')  can  be  applied  to  situations  that  are  metaphorically,  rather  than literally violent, such as in clothes with loudly-clashing colours. Thus, the  range of meanings associated with teroru are very different  than  those associated  with the  original  English  source  or even  the  earlier  loan tero, the  usage  of which  is arguably somewhat closer  to the  English  'terror'.

In  addition,  it  is significant  that  once  English  words  are  brought  into  the l a n g u a g e ,  whether  by  scientists  importing  the  latest jargon,  or t e e n a g e r s inventing  new  skateboard  slang,  such  words  often  assume  a  life  of  their  own, and  their  meanings  can  change  in  unpredictable  ways.  In  many  instances,  if an  English  word  retains  a  place  'in  the  language' (and  is  not  discarded or forgotten),  its  range  of  meanings  will  become  modified  and  will  thus  be  re› made  in Japan.  To  cite  one  recent  example  of  this,  one  might  consider  some of  the  various  terms  for  'computer',  'email',  and  ' P C  currently  used  in  Japan. The  English  'computer'  and  Japanese konpyuutaa, despite  their obvious linkage,  are  not  always  exactly  equivalent.  If you  talk  to  a Japanese  person,  or refer  to  one  of  the  popular  glossaries  of  current  phrases, you  will  indeed  find t h a t  both  terms  refer  to  electronic  machines  that  calculate  numbers and process  data  (Masakazu,  2002).  However,  while  Americans  or  Canadians  may have  'computers'  on  their  desks  at  home,  a Japanese  likely would  not.  As  one informant  said,  'To me, konpyuutaa represents  the whole  system. It is  something big.  It  is  like  a  c o m p u t e r  network  or  infrastructure.'  Instead, Japanese  people would  have  a waapuro ('word  processor')  or paso-kon ('personal  computer'), while  the  Japanese  English  acronym PC would  be  reserved  for ' p o l i t i c a l correctness'  or  'patrol  car'  (what Americans  call  a  'police  squad  car').  One  of t h e  reasons  for  this  is  that  until  relatively  recently, waa  puro, or  dedicated Japanese-language  word  processors,  were  more  commonly-used  than  desktop computers  for  writing  documents.

In  t h e  case  of  'e-mail',  there  are  a  n u m b e r  of  English  and  Japanese equivalents  available  to Japanese  language-users,  including  these  five:

|   1. | e > - )V              | ( l e'-meeru)                   |
|------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
|    2 | > - Jl                | (meeru 'mail')                  |
|    3 | M^-^- )\/             | (denshi-meeru 'electronic mail' |
|    4 | e-mail, E-mail, Email | (e-mail)                        |
|    5 | -f - / - )l*          | (ii-meeru)                      |

Arguably  the  most  neutral  term  of  the  five  is  number  3,  the  JapaneseEnglish  hybrid,  the  term  most  often  used  in  computer  instruction  books  or t e c h n i c a l  manuals.  Number  1 is  found  in  many  newspaper  and  magazine advertisements,  while  number  2 is the  most  colloquial  and  is very  popular  on t h e  Internet.  In  emails  themselves,  a  common  opening  line  is meeru moratta (T  got  your  mail')  or meeru  arigatoo ('Thanks  for  your  mail'),  and  the  hybrid is  rarely  if  ever  used  in  this  context (denshi-meeru  moratta for  T  got  your  mail' reads  very  oddly).  Number  4  illustrates  the  various  ways  of  writing  the  word 'e-mail'  on  business  cards, where  an  English  expression  is typically used.  Finally, one  should  note  that  the  last  form,  with  'e-mail'  written  completely  in t h e katakana script,  does  not,  to  my  knowledge,  occur  at  all.

There  are  many  other  instances  where  the  meanings  of  English t e r ms

become  restricted,  expanded,  or  modified  in  some  way. The  question  that  is raised  is,  then,  what  is a  'real'  loanword,  and  what  is  'made-in-Japan'  English? I  would  suggest  here  that  almost  all  the  high-frequency  English  words  in everyday  use  in  the  country  are  either  'made-in-Japan'  or  undergo such modifications  that  we  may  argue  that  they  are re-made in  J a p a n .

At  present,  the  creation  and  influx  of  English  words  shows  no  signs  of diminishing,  and  a  recent  study  suggested  that  the  proportion  of  English loanwords  in Japanese-language  newspapers  had  increased  by 33 percent  over a  fifteen-year  period  (Minami,  Shinoo,  and  Asahi  Shimbun  Gakugeibu,  2002). Few  societies  in  today's  world  appear  to  borrow  so  extensively,  and  with  such variety and  enthusiasm.  There  may be  a number  of reasons  for  this. First,  there is  a  tradition  of  linguistic  borrowing  (at  both  the  spoken  and  written  level) that  can  be  traced  back  to  contact  with  the  Chinese  language  at  least  sixteen hundred  years  ago, when  written  Chinese  provided  the  basis  of  the  Japanese writing  system.  Second,  the  minimum  of  six years  of  English  education t h a t almost  every Japanese  child  receives  contributes  to a common  pool  of  symbolic and  linguistic  knowledge  that  provides  an  extra  resource  for  many different communicative  activities,  from  casual  conversation  to  intellectual  discussions. This,  combined  with  the Japanese  people's  strong  interest  in  things  western, suggests  that  the  motivations  for  English ' b o r r o w i n g '  and  'creation' are explicable only  t h r o u g h r e f e r e n c e to a r a n g e of  social a n d political considerations.  I  do  my  best  to  explore  these  issues  throughout  this  volume. In  the  following  sections  of  this  chapter,  however,  I  shall  elaborate  on t h e notion  that Japanese  English  (as defined  and  explained  above,  i.e.  comprising both  loanwords  and  created  words)  functions  as  a  linguistic  and cultural resource  in  a  range  of  subtle  and  often  unexpected  ways.

## Japanese  English  and  the  'beautiful  human  life'

In  every Japanese  city, an  American  or  British  visitor  is immediately  struck  by the  ubiquity  of  English  signage  in  a  society where  a functional  grasp  of  English (at  least  for  everyday  communicative  purposes)  seems  fragmented  at  best.  On a  r e c e n t  visit  to  Tokyo,  I  noticed  a  young OL (office  lady),  standing  outside  a beauty  parlor,  reading  the  neon  sign  flashing  in  English  before her:

ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH YOUR HAIR? IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SUPER BEAUTICIAN TRY "KENZO" BEAUTY SALON. WE  KNOW YOU WILL BE HAPPY! !

After  just  a  few  seconds'  hesitation,  she  walked  in  order  to  get  a paama ( ' p e r m ' ) ,  or  some  other  hair  treatment.  On  another  occasion  in  Hokkaido,  I saw  two  teenagers  approach  the Coin  Snack vending-machine,  and  look  over

Figure 2.1 Kenzo beauty salon

t he  available  selections.  They  were  standing  in  a  machine  emblazoned  with  a photograph  of  an  American  motorcycle  cop  and  a  US  airman,  both  staring i n t o  t he  sunset  holding  their  cans Georgia Kafe  Ore ( ' G e orgia  coffee  ole').  As t h e  two  boys  collected  their  cans  from  the  tray,  the  machine flashed:

THANK YOU.' ANYTIME YOU WANT  TO  TAKE A  REST PLEASE REMEMBER  WE'RE ALWAYS HERE AND  WAITING FOR YOUR COMING.

Not  long  ago,  in  a  coffee shop  in  Kyoto,  I  sat  and  listened  as  the  j u k e b o x played  a  song  by  Matsutooya  Yumi  (Turning'),  a  female  pop  icon  in t h e New Music movement  of the  1970s and  1980s. I reflected  on  the  creative  blend of  English  and Japanese  in  the  chorus  of  the  song  entitled Sukoshidake Kataomoi ('Just  a  little  u n r e q u i t e d l o v e ' ) :

Itsu datte I love you more than you, You love me sukoshi dake, Kata-omoi more than you

This  might  be  broadly  glossed  as It's  always  so /  that  I  love you  more than  you  love me /  you  only  love  me a  little  bit /  It 5 always  unrequited love.

I  present  these  anecdotes  here  to  illustrate  the  often  unexpected  ways  in which  English  occurs in Japanese  society. However,  as I have mentioned  earlier, the  use  of English  is not  restricted  to signage  and  pop  culture, but  is  imbricated in  the  fabric  of Japanese  life  in  a  myriad  of ways, from  the  media  to  academic life,  from  advertising  to  personal  conversation.  In  the  next  section  of  this chapter  I  extend  the  discussion  of Japan  English  today  by  considering  a

number  of the  symbolic functions  of English,  and  examining  how certain  terms have  become  established  public  symbols  while  others  are  reserved  for  private purposes,  noting  the  interrelationships  between  the  individual's  uses of  English and  institutionalized  displays  of  the  language.  Finally,  I provide  a  brief  guide to  the  current  language  debates  on  English  in Japan  (and Japanese  English), which  find  regular  expression  in  the  discourse  of  academics,  educationalists, and  the  media.

## The  symbols and  exhibitions  of Japanese  English  in  public  and private  space

One  of  the  important  contributions  that  anthropologists  have  made  to  the study  of  symbolism  has  been  in  the  analysis  of  the  relations  between t h e collective  and  the  individual  components  of  symbols.  Firth  (1973)  calls  these the  'public'  and  'private'  aspects  of symbolism,  terms  that  refer  to  the  creation of  symbols,  their  presence  in  the  minds  of  particular  individuals,  and t heir collective  use  'in  the  culture'.  Symbols  also  have  manifestations,  either  in personal  displays  or  institutional  exhibitions.  In  this  section,  I will  discuss  the symbolic  and  the  performance  aspects  (or  'exhibitions')  of  English  words  in Japanese:  how  and  for  what  purposes  they  are  created,  and  how  they  are displayed  or  exhibited.  Symbols  that  have  group  effects,  and  those  that  have social  appeal  and  consciousness,  or  represent  the  values  and  aspects  of  the collectivity,  can  be  termed  'public  symbols', whereas  the  term  'private  symbols' refer  to  those  whose  use  and  effect  may  be  more  typically  observed  in t h e individual  and  personal  lives  of  people  (and  may  not  be  shared  by  everyone in  a  culture).  Leach  (1976)  claims  that  public  symbols  are  associated  with  acts of  communication,  while  private  symbols  are  associated  with  expression.  My argument  here  is that Japanese  English  plays an  interesting  role  in  both  types of  symbolism  in  Japan.

One  obvious  and  emblematic  example  of  the  public  symbolism  of what  I am  calling Japanese  English  here  is  seen  in  the commercial  messages  (CMs or ' advertising  slogans')  for  that  most American  of products, Coca-Cola. In  a  recent nationwide  campaign,  the  lead  slogan  for  the  campaign  has  been Saivayaka, teisuti,  I feel  Coke!, which  might  be  translated  as  Refreshing,  tasty,  I feel [like] Coke'.  In  order  to  promote  their  product  in  this  campaign, Coca-Cola in  J a p a n devised  video  campaigns  aimed  at  three  distinct  groups:  young  people,  older age-groups,  and  housewives.  Casually-dressed  youngsters  pose  for t h e camera  and  flash  their  young  smiles,  and  the  background  and  each  person has  a  coke  can  in  their  hand  or  mouth.  Smiles  are  in  abundance  as  the  catchy lyrics  of  the jingle  ring  out:

Figure  2.2 I feel  Coke: Swayaka Teisuti Koka Korra

<!-- image -->

Itsumo machi ga I  feel Coke! I  feel Coke! kanji  no mama kono toki yo!

Sawayaka, teisuti, I feel Coke!

Always the  town  feels  'I feel  Coke'! I feel  Coke! Keeping  this Coke  feeling just  like  now! Refreshing, tasty, I  feel Coke!

The imeeji (images)  here  are  aimed  at  young  people,  depicting  all  the  fun to be  had  when  drinking  Coke, and  how cool you can  look. The  song also  appears aimed  at  the  so-called shinjinrui (the  'new  generation'), with  its visual  messages of  individualism  'doing your  own  thing',  and  'doing  it now'.  Linguistically,  the j i n g l e  is  i n t e r e s t i n g  because  of  the  embedded  code-switching  from  Japanese to  English  throughout  and  the  use  of  the Japanese  English teisuti for  tasty.

The  second  commercial  is designed  to  appeal  to  older  folks,  and  perhaps for  those yet  to  develop  a taste for  the  most  successful  aerated-dyed-water  drink of  all  time.  This  time  the jingle  goes: Itsuka kimi  ni  I feel  Coke! /1 feel  Coke!  / ivakaru  hazu  sa  /  itsuka  datte!  /  sawayaka, teisuti,  I feel  Coke!, which  translates  as ' S o meday  you'll  know  as  I  do,  / this  feeling  of  I  feel  Coke!  / I  feel  Coke! / refreshing,  tasty,  I  feel  Coke!  / '.  Instead  of  the  images  of  the shinjuku generation,  we  see  traditional  scenes:  people  pulling  up  fishing nets, grandmothers  sitting  on  the  steps  of  traditional  country  houses, s u m mer festivals,  and  a  young  kimono-clad  girl  smiling  holding  a  can  of  Coke.  Her enticing  smile  beckons  Grandma  to  try  it,  to  experience t h e  cool and

at  t h e  average  Japanese  housewife  and  mother.  Here  we  see everyday housewives  in  their  aprons  doing  the  laundry,  women  talking  on  pay  phones, and  mothers  with  babies  meeting  each  other  on  the  street.  This  time  the  words of  the  song  ring  out: Itsuka aeba I  feel  Coke! /1  feel  Coke! /  wakaru  hazu  sa / itsuka date /  Sawayaka, teisuti,  I feel  Coke! ('Sometime,  when  we  meet,  I feel  Coke!  / I feel  Coke! You  should  know  /  someday  /  refreshing,  tasty, I feel  Coke!  / ' .  The final  shot  is  a  Coke  machine  in  front  of  a Japanese-style  home  at  dusk,  with everyone  getting  ready  for  dinner.

In  all  three  films,  certain Japanese  English  words  and  phrases,  namely, teisuti (tasty),  and I feel  Coke!, are  used  to  complement  the  visual  language  of the  advertisers.  Such  phrases  may communicate  different  messages  to  different speakers  and  age  groups,  but  they  nevertheless  invoke  a  shared  frame of reference  general  enough  across  such  groups.  In  this  context,  then,  there  is direct  evidence  to  support  the  claim  that  such Japanese  English  words  and phrases  serve  as very  effective  public  symbols  in  the  worlds  of  advertising  and consumer  culture.

The  use  of  items  of Japanese  English  to  express  private  symbols  may  be found  in  colour-naming  practices  in Japan.  As we  will  see  in  Chapter  9,  the Japanese  language  has  appropriated  the  basic  lexicon  of  colour  vocabulary from  English,  along  with  many  secondary  colour  terms  (Stanlaw, 1987a; 1997a).  This  additional Japanese  English  colour  vocabulary  creates  the  space for  creativity and  innovation  when  speaking  or writing of colours. For  example, in  my  earlier  research  on  this  topic,  I asked  a  female  informant  to  name t he hues  of  a  n u m b e r  of  ambiguously  coloured  objects.  In  the  face  of  uncertainty, e.g.  when  the  shade  in  question  was  not  obviously  a  simple aka ('red')  or ao ('blue'),  she  often  resorted  to  English  colour  terms. When  English  basic  terms did  not  exactly  suffice (which  was  often),  she  refined  her  answer  by  creating English-based  compound  and  secondary  colour  terms,  using  words  like roozu paapuru ('rose  purple'), hotto buruu ('hot  blue'), and howaitoguree ('white  grey') i n  our  interviews.  When  asked  to  explain  the  origin  of  such  terms;  she responded,  T guess  I just  made  them  up.'  Further  questioning  revealed  that she  had  used  a  number  of  these  'made-up'  terms  before:  'Oh  yes,  in  fact,  I have  used peeru  paapuru ('pale  purple')  many  times  before.  My  friend  has  a dress  that  is  almost  that  colour' (Stanlaw,  1987a).  This  informant  was  not untypical  as many  others  responded  in  similar ways during  my interviews.  Their accounts  suggest  that Japanese  people  often  use  English  loanwords  to  create new  vocabulary  items  in  their  everyday  speech,  or  to  simply  play  with t h e language,  a finding  supported  by other  researchers  in  this field  (Sibata,  1975). This  example  suggests  that  such  new  linguistic  forms,  expressed  in  a  form  of Japanese  English,  can  thus  serve  as dynamic  and  effective  private  symbols  and, whatever  their  private  provenance,  are  also  readily  understandable  by  other members  of  contemporary  Japanese  society.

In  addition  to  the  level  of  private  and  public  symbols just  discussed,  there is  a n o t h e r  related  dimension  of Japanese  English  use  to  consider  in this context.  Having just  discussed  how  symbols  originate  or  are  created,  we  can now  proceed  to  examine  how  and  where  such  symbols  are  displayed or ' e x hibited'.  There  are  personal  and  public  dimensions  to  this  as well  but  here I  would  argue  there  is  a  less  obvious  distinction  between  private  and  public space  (given  the  activity  of  'display'),  but  rather  of  a  cline  of differences between  different types  of  displays  and  exhibitions.  Here,  I  discuss  two examples  of  such  activity:  (i)  the  personal  displays  of  the  amateur  musicians in  a  Tokyo  park;  and  (ii)  the  institutionalized  exhibitions  of song  lyrics  penned by  a  major  female  pop  singer.

I  have  elsewhere  discussed  the  personal  displays  of  the  amateur rock musicians  who  gather  in  Tokyo's  Yoyogi  Park  on  Sundays  (Stanlaw,  1990a). Most  of  these  performers  use  English  names,  and  their  PR  signs,  costumes, posters,  and  so  on,  are  also  filled  with Japanese  English  phrases.  For  example, one  group  who  called  themselves The  Tomcats spray-painted  phrases  like 'We Are Big  Bad  Cat,'  'No Money, 'and Mad  Route' on their van. Their  performance schedule  was  titled 'Tomcat  Live'. Even  solo  amateur  musicians  like  'St.  Kazu' play  their  guitars  and  put  up  banners  reminding  the  audience  that  they  are playing Somewhere  today  out  on  the  street. Another  group  in  Yoyogi  Park  were named  was Tokyo Rocan  Roller, written  in  roman  letters  which  can  be  read  as ' Tokyo  rock  and  rollers'  (see  Figure  2.3  below).  However,  above  the  middle word  of  their  name  were  written  two  small  Sino-Japanese  characters,  A\/S* (which  translate  as rokan, or  'the  six  senses').  Thus  the  name  spells  out t he fact  that  they  are  Tokyo  rock  and  rollers,  but  also  makes  the  claim  that  they are  a  delight  to  the  senses.  Of  course,  in  this  setting,  the  distinction  between t he  personal  and  the  public  is  blurred,  but  it  is worth  noting  that  they  were not  professional  musicians,  but  a  group  of  teenagers  in  a  garage  band.

Example  of institutionalized  displays can  be  seen  in  many  of the  song  lyrics of  c o n t e m p o r a r y  J a p a n e s e  pop  music  (Stanlaw,  1989;  1998;  2000a).  For example,  the  famous  female  singer  Matsutooya Yumi  (see  also  Chapter  5)  uses (' Dandelion').

several  English  images  and  metaphors  in  her  song Dandiraion In  one  of  the  choruses,  she  sings:

Kimi wa dandiraion Kizutsuita  hibi wa kare ni  de-au tame no soo yo unmei ga yooi shite kureta taisetsu-na ressun Ima suteki-na redii ni  nam

You are  a  dandelion. Those days, when your heart was hurt

fate  arranged for you to have in order to meet him some important lessons. You have now become a wonderful woman.

This  song  in  the  original  is laced  with  the  lyricism  that  has  made  Yuming famous  in Japan.  She  sings  that  her  love  floats  like  dandelion  seeds  over the  water,  and  will  endure  to  bloom  again.  The  dandelion  images  in  her song  seem  to  be  written  to  express  the  fragility  of  romantic  love,  and  the possibility  of  its  survival  and  growth.  For  Westerners  the  dandelion  image may appear  mundane  or  trivial,  but  informants  tell  me  that  if Yuming  had used  the  standard Japanese  word tampopo for  dandelion,  the  song  would have  sound  like  a folksong,  sung  by a country  girl  in  love  to  a  country  lad. Instead,  the  English  loanword dandiraion lets  any Japanese  office  lady  relate to  the  song.  In  an  interview  with  me, Yuming  told  me  that  she  used  the title Dandiraion because  she  liked  the  impression  that  she  felt  the  word  gave of  an  English  hillside,  and  that  she  wanted  to  throw  in  'a  little  fragrance  of Western  culture'.

In  both  cases,  we  see  that  personal  displays  and institutionalized exhibitions  are  often  made  by using English  loanwords. The  signs and  songs of  the  amateur  rock  musicians  had  an  ad  hoc  and  individual  feeling,  and were probably intended  only for  temporary use and  immediate  consumption. Yuming's hit song, however, is more  permanent  and  lasting, and  has  become

part  of  the  enduring  history  of  recorded  music.  English  words  and  images  are readily  incorporated  in  both  kinds  of  manifestations.  The  two  dimensions  of symbol  creation  and  display  discussed  above  are  interconnected,  and these connections  (with  reference  to  the  four  of  the  language  usage  examples discussed  above)  are  illustrated  by  Table  2.4  below:

Table 2.4 The relationships between  symbols and  exhibitions

Private exhibitions

Public  exhibitions

| public symbols   | amateur park musicians        | Coke TV commercials   |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| private symbols  | informant's colour term usage | Yuming's song lyrics  |

Although  it  might  appear  that  ordering  these  cases  in  tabular  form  is  a somewhat  reductive  exercise,  this  may  yield  some  insights.  For  example, Yuming uses private symbols and  institutionalizes  them  permanently  on  record. The  Coke  advertisers  coined  the  slogan 'Ifeel  Coke!' themselves, but  their  intent is  quite  different.  Theirs  is  no  private  response  to  personal  sensations,  but r a t h e r  a  cleverly-engineered  marketing  pitch.  Like  Yuming's  song, t h e i r advertisement  became  institutionalized,  but  the  words  used  and  symbols invoked  are  communal  and  public  to  a far  greater  degree.  The  amateur  rock and  rollers  in  Yoyogi  Park  created  their  English  signs  and  phrases  privately themselves,  but  these  were  intended  to  be  read  and  interpreted  by the  public. However,  despite  their  wild  clothes  and  extrovert  performance,  these  are largely personal  displays not  directly intended  to become  institutionalized.  The woman  who  discussed  colour  terminology  with  me  created  many  of  these English  words  and  phrases  herself,  and  had  little  concern  whether t h e s e symbols  became  institutionalized  or  not,  save  perhaps  in  conversation  with friends.  Hers  then  were  the  most  personal  and  idiosyncratic  of all  the  examples given,  but  nevertheless  exemplify  an  increasingly  common  aspect  of Japanese communicative  practices.

## The  intelligibility  of Japanese  English

In Japan  today  there  are  many  people  who  express  confusion  at  the  use  of English  in  the  modern Japanese  language.  Some  older  people  lament: Ichi-do kiita  dake de, doo iu  imi ka wakarimasu  ka? ('How  are you  supposed  to  understand that  the  first  time  hearing  it?').  Some  newer  items  are  no  doubt  confusing to the  older  generation,  but  in  many  societies  in  the  world,  slang  and  other  forms of  linguistic  innovation  is associated  with  the  speech  habits  of  the  young.  This is  also  true  of Japanese  English,  which  in  contemporary  society  is  often regarded  as  'hip'  and  modern.

This  is  noticeably  true  in  the  pop  music  world,  where  it is claimed  that  it is almost  compulsory  to speak Japanese  with  a Western  flavour.  Mashui  Masami, a  musical  booking  agent,  was interviewed  by a magazine  called LIB a  few  years ago,  and  I  translate  his  answer  to  one  question  below.  The  translation  shows j u s t  how  frequent  the  occurrence  of  loanwords  in  his  speech  is:

New Yorkers' (Nyuu  Yookaa) select night clubs not only on  the basis of  'space' (supeesu) but  they  also  care  for  the  'epoch  maker' (eppokku meekaa) that  is created by the  'policy' (porishii) and  the  'concept' (konseputo). This is especially true  as  the  'night  scene' (naito-shiin) is  multi-coloured.  In  the  very  'trendy clubs' (torendii na kurabu) are  the  major  shows, that  is, the  'sound' (saundo) called  'house  music' (hausu-myuujikku). The  kind  of  clubs  are  the  'regular club' (regyuraa-kurabu) which  'open' (oopun) around  9:00  or  10:00 pm,  and they  'close' (kuroozu) at  4:00 am; or  the  'supper  clubs' (sapaa-kurabu); or  the 'after  hours' (afutaa-awaazu) club which  are  'open' (oopun) from  midnight until  lunch  time  of  the  following  day;  or  the  'one  night  clubs' (wan  naitokurabu) which  open  for  only one  day,  [usually]  on  the  same  day of the  week .  . . there  are  usually some  connections  required. And  they have many  'event nights' (ibento-naito) such  as  'Korean  Night' (korian-naito) and  'Placido Domingo  Night' (domingo-naito). When  I went  back  this  time,  I was told  by the  'producer' (purodyuusaa) who owns the  'Dead  Zone' (deddo-zoon) that  he is going  to  play  a  'Pearl  Harbor  Night' (paaru  haabaa-naito). For  this  event he is calling in a Japanese  'DJ' (disuku-jyokkii), a  Japanese  'staff (sutaffu), and a Japanese  'dancer' (dansaa). (Inoue,  1993: 128)

This  particular  variety  of  hip Japanese  English  is simply  not  accessible  to  most Japanese,  and,  when  asked  for  his  response,  a Japanese  colleague  fluent  in English  commented:  T have  absolutely  no  idea  at all what  this person  is  talking about!  The  only  thing  I  can t h i n k of  is,  it is  s o m e guy  who  is  a cool businessman,  who  wears  sunglasses  and  an  expensive  black  leather jacket.'  So t h e  l o a n w o r d s  appear  to  create  an  opaque  in-group  jargon  for  a  specific occupational  and  interest  in-group  here,  i.e.  music  industry  professionals  and pop  music  aficionados.

The  question  of  intelligibility  also  arises  in  sports  broadcasting, for instance, which  in  standard Japanese  calls for  a vivid  play-by-play  commentary, marked  by such  phrases Utta! ('It's  a  hit!'), Haitta! ('It's  entered  the  stands!'), or 'Ii atari' ('A  good  hit!)  (Inagaki,  1995; Maitland,  1991).  English  phrases  are often  used  in  similar  situations,  in  similar  ways, e.g., 'Tatchi  auto' ('He's  tagged out!'  literally  meaning 'touch  out) or shooto goro ('It's  a  blazing  ground  ball!', literally  meaning  a  'shot' goro goro; i.e.  an  onomatopoeic  expression  suggesting something  rolling  or  rumbling).  English  words  can  also  be  used  as  adjectives and  adverbs: pawafuru-na battingu ('powerful  batting'), iijiifurai (an  'easy  fly' to  catch), sutiiru shita ('stolen  base',  literally  meaning  'did  a steal). Inagaki calls  such  phrases  ' n o u n  stops'  (a  not  unproblematic  grammatical t a g ) , suggesting  that  these  are  short  of  noun-like  locutions  of  key  vocabulary.

Significantly,  however,  he  argues  that  English  loanwords  play  a  similar  role  in Japanese,  with Japanese  English  phrases  accounting  for  some  34.9%  of  such phrases  in  sports  commentaries  (Inagi,  1995). All of which  suggests  that  many of  such  phrases  must  be  well-known  among  the  general  public.

The  issue  of  intelligibility  is  also  of  crucial  interest  to  the advertising industry.  Despite  the  claim  by some  commentators  that  some Japanese  English in  advertising is  not easily  c o m p r e h e n s i b l e , my  own  interviews with advertising  industry  professionals  have  indicated  that  the Japanese English i n  t h e  copy  is  regularly  checked  for  intelligibility.  For  example, one i n f o r m a n t  from  the  Dentsu  company  told  me  that  all  material  was  checked with Japanese  speakers:  'After  all, we  couldn't  sell  something  if people  didn't understand  what  we  were  selling,  right?'  Executives  told  me  that t h e i r campaigns  used  words  that  most  people  could  recognize  and  respond  to. Although  the  intent  of  using katakana-kotoba (foreign  italicized  words)  was certainly  to  create  eye-catching  copy,  obscure  terms  were scrupulously avoided;  advertisements,  they  asserted,  had  to  convey  information  about  the product,  not  confuse  the  audience.

Examples  of Japanese  English  embedded  in  advertising  slogans  and  copy i nclude  the  following  taken  from  Sugano  (1995:  841):

kaasonaritii [Nissan] 'carsonality'  (versus  'personality')

Rosu e wa yoru tobuto rosu ga nai [Pan American  Airlines] 'When you fly at night to Los Angeles [Rosu in Japanese]  there  is no loss'

kuuru  minto Guamu [Japan  Airlines]

'cool-mint  Guam'  (advertisement  for  flights  to Guam  )

Uesuto saizu sutoorii 'West Size  Story'

[Keioo Department  Stores]

Word  play  and  puns  obviously  play  an  important  role  in  these  examples, although  the  punning  can  also  extend  to  the Japanese  elements  in  copy,  such as Guam  Guam  Everybody ('Gan  Gan  Everybody!'), which was a slogan  in  a Japan Airlines  advertisement. Gan  gan in  J a p a n e s e  corresponds  to  'Go!  Go!'  in English,  thus  suggesting  that  consumers  should  rush  to  Guam  for  a  vacation. The popularity  of Japanese  English  phrases  and  the  use  of English  as an  added linguistic  resource  in  advertising  has  led  to  accusations  that  the  industry  is  a main  instigator  of linguistic  'pollution'  in  society, although,  as I have  indicated earlier,  the  empirical  basis  of  such  charges  is shaky  at  best.  As for  the  issue  of intelligibility,  evidence  suggests  that  many  of  these Japanese  English  phrases and  words  enjoy  a  high  level  of  comprehensibility  in  the  general  community.

A  wider  issue  is  the  problem of ' m e a n i n g ' in  general.  One  of t h e conclusions  that  Haarman (1989) r e a c h e d  in  his  research  on  Japanese television  commercials was that  '[a]lthough  a majority  of viewers can  recognize

catch  phrases  in  English  from  TV commercials,  their meaning  is completely clear  only  to  a  minority.'  He  based  this  conclusion  on  the  results  of  a questionnaire  given  to  about  eight  hundred  college  students,  who  were asked  to  explain  the  meanings  of  nine  commonly  heard  slogans,  such  as For Beautiful Life (Shiseido  cosmetics), My  life -My gas (the  Tokyo  Gas Company),  and Do you  know  met (American  Express).  According  to Haarman,  fewer  than  50  percent  of  the  respondents  gave  the ' r i g h t ' explanation  of such  slogans. However, an  approach  like Haarman's  assumes that  there  is an  unequivocal  'right'  explanation  of  these  slogans. This  may not  be  the  case.  How  many  Americans,  for  example,  are  able  to  give  the correct  explanation  of  such  popular  US  slogans  as  'It's  the  heartbeat  of America?'  (Chevrolet), or  'Marlboro  Country'  (Marlboro's  cigarettes)?  The point  surely  is that  there  is no  one  single  'real'  meaning  of  such  Japanese English  phrases waiting  to be  discovered,  accessible  only  to  those Japanese with  an  attested  high  level  of  proficiency  in  the  English  language.  As we saw in  some  examples  in  the  case  of  the  woman  creating  her  own  Englishbased  colour  terms,  in  the  realm  of  the  personal,  meaning  is  sometimes constructed  and  negotiated  by  speakers  in  a  particular  context, for particular  and  private  purposes.

Some people in Japan would be loath  to accept such an argument.  Many English  language  teachers  in Japan,  both Japanese  and  foreign,  appear  to detest  the  occurrence  of Japanese  English,  in  all  its various  forms.  In  one interview,  an  American  teacher  commented,  '[f]or  one  thing,  it makes  our j o b  so  much  more  difficult,  they  come  into  our  class  thinking  they  already know so much  English, when  in fact  they actually have to unlearn  a lot'.  This again  reminds  us  that  much  of  the  'English'  in Japan  is of  the  home-grown variety,  and  the  meanings  of many  'loanwords'  are  typically modified  in  the Japanese  context  to express rather  different  meanings  than  their  equivalents in  other  varieties  of  English.  Sometimes  these  meanings  differ  in  small  and subtle ways, while at other  times  they differ  more  radically.

## The  issue  of  'loanwords'  and Japanese  English

In  the  earlier  sections  of  this  chapter,  I discuss  a number  of  points  related to  the  issue  of  lexical  borrowing  and  'loanwords'.  One  general  point  here is  that  in  all  languages  there  is  cline  of  'loanwordness'  with  respect  to borrowed  items. For  example, most Americans would  know regard  the  word 'restaurant'  as an  item  of American  English,  but  might  be variably  uncertain how  to  treat  such  words  as  'lingerie',  'rendezvous',  or  'menage  a  trois'. As mentioned  earlier,  the  problem  of defining  what is a  'loanword'  in Japanese is  not  a  simple  task.  Many  of  these  terms  are  not  imported  at  all, but  made in Japan (wa-sei eigo). Because  of  the  almost  universal  presence  of  English

l a n g u a g e  programmes  in  the  Japanese  education  system,  the distinction between  'borrowed'  and  'indigenous'  items  is further  blurred.  For  example, i t e m s  such  as  the  English  n u m b e r  system,  the  English  basic  colour t e r m system,  and  the  English  body  parts  system  are  now  part  of  the s p e e c h r e p e r t o i r e  of  almost  every Japanese.  In  addition,  the katakana syllabary  of t h e  writing  system  allows  both  for  the  somewhat  easy  importation  and t h e nativization  of  such  items  within Japanese.  Spelling  a  word  in  the katakana writing  system  instantly  nativizes  any  new  item  by  adapting  the  borrowed i t e m  to  the  J a p a n e s e  phonological  system.

If  we  go  beyond  mere  individual  lexical  items  and  look  at  whole  phrases or  sentences  which  are  borrowed,  such  as ai  rabuyuu (T  love you'),  a  number of  other  points  may be  made.  First,  many  of  these  phrases  are  created  in Japan, and,  second,  many  English  items  are  often  incorporated  into ' r e a l ' J a p a n e s e collocations,  as  in  the  ' Saivayaka, teisuti, I feel  Coke example  already  given. Third,  we  also  need  to  acknowledge  that  most  British  and  US  'native'  English speakers  would  have  difficulty  in  explaining  what  many  of  these ' E n g l i s h ' phrases  (e.g. New  Life  Scene  Creator, a  slogan  for Lebel Shampoo) are  supposed to  mean,  as would  speakers  of other  varieties  of English. Which  again  supports t h e  claim  that  many  such  words  and  phrases  are  not ' l o a n w o r d s ' in a conventional  interpretation,  but  rather  items  of  a  distinct  variety  of  Japanese English'  in  the wasei-eigo ( J a p a n e s e - m a d e  English')  sense.

In  response  to  this,  others  have  asserted  that  all  those  items  that are regularly  written  in rooma-ji (' r o m a n  letters')  should  be  classified  as gairaigo ('loanwords',  ^5fcfg  ).  One  major  problem  with  this,  however,  is  that  there  is a  good  deal  of variation  in  the  orthography  used  to  represent  English  words. For  example,  one  hit song in  the  early  1990s from  the female  rock band Princess Princess was  sometimes  written  as Diamonds (in  English) and sometimes nativized  in  the katakana syllabary  as y^"V^&gt; K (daiyamondo). Which  raises the  question  of whether  both  forms  should  be  regarded  as loanwords,  or  not. A second  point  is  that,  in  certain  contexts,  roman  letters  are  apparently  used for  visual  purposes  only,  as  in  the  case  of  clothes  and  many  other  personal belongings  where  some  kind  of  English  word  or  phrase  is almost  compulsory. At  the  same  time,  it  is  not  u n c o m m o n for  J a p a n e s e  words  or  names  to  be written  in rooma-ji t o  create  an  artistic  or  visual effect.

In  brief, Japanese  language-users  today  appear  to  be  experimenting  with the  orthographic  and  visual  aspects  of  their  language  and  writing  systems  in  a way  reminiscent  of  their  importation  of  Chinese  in  the  fifth century  AD.  In the  contemporary  context,  although  many Japanese  English  words  are  'taken' from  English  in  some  instances,  in  other  cases  they  may  never  have  been ' i n the  language'  to start with, at least not  in  the  form  that  they appear  in Japanese. WTien it comes  to  deciding what  an  English  'loanword'  in  contemporary  Japan is,  I would  argue  that  discussion  of  this  issue  has  been  blurred  by  the  adoption of  a  false  metaphor,  that  is the  notion  of  'borrowing',  which  in  this  context  is both  misleading  and  problematic.

## Borrowing  revisited:  Loanwords  and Japanese  English

Traditionally,  many  linguists  have  viewed  language  contact  (correctly  or otherwise)  in  terms  of  senders  and  receivers,  contributors  and  recipients, borrowers  and  givers. This  perspective  typically involves looking  at  linguistic contact  from  the  vantage  point  of  the  donor  language,  and  in Japan  finds expression  in  what  I  have  called  the  'English  loanwords'  approach.  An alternative  way discussing  language  contact  in Japan  is to  eschew  the  term 'loanword',  and  to attempt  to analyse and  interpret  such  patterns of  linguistic contact  from  the Japanese  perspective.  Instead  of  focusing  solely  on  the convergence  or  divergence  of patterns  of Japanese  English  from  the  norms of  notional  British  and  American  standards,  we might  rather  highlight  the motivations  and  purposes  supporting  the  creation  of  English  words  and phrases within Japanese  society. This approach,  I believe, has the potential  to offer  many  insights.  By this  I am  not  only  referring  to  the  study  of wasei-eigo ('Japanese-made  English'),  but  also  to  the  whole  range  of  discourses  that attend  the  acceptance,  construction,  creation,  and  even  resistance  and rejection  to the language in its Japanese contexts; so that we may move towards a  consideration  of  Japanese  English'  in  a much  wider  sense.

Within  the  linguistics  literature,  linguists  typically  classified lexical borrowings in terms of four  processes: 'loanwords', 'loan  blends',  'loan  shifts', and  'loan  translations'  (or  'caiques')  (see Haugen,  1972; Lehiste,  1988).  The differences  between  these  categories  depend  on  how a linguistic  unit's  form in  terms of the  phonological  and  morphological  structure  of the word  and  its meaning  originate  in  the  donor  language  and  are  manifested  in  a  recipient language. In  this framework,  a 'loanword'  is a term where both  the form  and the  meaning  are  borrowed,  as in  such  items as geisha,  blitzkrieg, or perestroika. A 'loan  blend'  is an  item where the meaning is borrowed  but part of the  form retains  a  characteristic  from  the  donor  language. An  example  of  this  might be  'beatnik', which  combines  the English  'beat' with a Slavic diminutive  suffix nik. A 'loan  shift'  is where  a  new  borrowed  meaning  is imposed  on  a  form native to the recipient language, as in the adoption  of the native English word ' go'  to  refer  to  the Japanese  board  game  carrying an  orthographically  similar name  in Japanese go or igo.  A 'loan  translation',  finally,  is a  morpheme-formorpheme  translation  from  the donor language into the borrowing language, as in  the  English  word  'superman',  derived  from  Nietzsche's ubermensch.

The  four  types  of  borrowing  discussed  here  represent  specific  types  of lexical  transfer.  However,  the  basic  general  formula  is based  on  a  unitary assumption: that there is a concept/meaning unit that is taken  (or  'borrowed') from  a  foreign  language  into  the  target  language.  This  concept  may  be encoded  totally in  the  linguistic  form  of  the  host  language  ('loan  shift'  and ' l oan  translation'),  totally  encoded  in  the  form  of  the  donor  language ('loanword'),  or  a mixture  of both  ('loan  blend').

The  argument  that  all  such  lexical  transfers  should  be  regarded  as  the incorporation  of  'foreign  elements'  in  the Japanese  language  rests heavily  on the borrowing metaphor.  In this view, words or phrases, i.e. linguistic symbols, are  little  different  from  physical  objects.  Those  who  take  this  'loanword approach'  claim  that  it  is  impossible  to  detach  the  foreignness  from the borrowed  linguistic  elements. For example, ordering  a drink on za rokku ('on the  rocks')  conjures  up  notions  of  suave,  debonair  Western  men  in  dinner jackets,  far-away  places,  and  so  on,  and  it  is  these  properties  of  being Western  and  chic  that  caused  the  word  to  be  borrowed  in  the  first  place. Similarly,  the  proponents  of  such  an  approach  argue  that  even  if  such  a lexical  item  has  a long  history  in  the  recipient  language,  there  is still  some symbolic  baggage  left  over.  Today,  after  nearly  fifteen  hundred  years,  some commentators  still  claim  that  Chinese  loans  and  Chinese  readings  of characters  still  sound  noticeably  different  than  native Japanese  terms,  and that  their  excessive  use  sounds  overly  erudite,  literary,  or  pedantic.  The bottom  line  of  this  argument,  then,  is  that  it  is impossible  to  incorporate English  elements  into Japanese  without  also  accepting  a  symbolic  package with  each  imported  item,  and  that,  as  noted  above,  English  loanwords  are English  and  they  are  loanwords.

An alternative view is that loanwords are  not loanwords at all, as  nothing is  really  borrowed,  and  nothing  is given  back.  'Borrowing',  then,  is less  an adequate  descriptive  term  than  a somewhat vague metaphor  used  to  describe the  complex  patterning  of cultural  and  linguistic  contact.  In  this view,  many Japanese  English  loanwords  are  more  accurately  (if  somewhat  clumsily) described  as  'English-inspired  vocabulary  items'.  Here,  the  argument  is  that the  'donor'  language, e.g. English, may motivate or inspire the local  formation of some  new phonological  symbol  or  a new conceptual  unit  in Japanese,  but this  is  simply  not  the  same  process  as  'borrowing'  an  item  from  a  foreign language  into Japanese.  As I  have  argued  above,  my belief  is  that  a  large proportion (if  not  the  majority) of Japanese  English  words  are  of  the indigenous  'home  grown'  variety,  despite  a  degree  of  overlap  between  a Japanese  term  and  a corresponding  English  item.

In support of this, one  may cite specific  items. For example, the Japanese English  equivalent  to  air-conditioner  is kuuraa (or  'cooler')  which  may  be unfamiliar  to users of other varieties of English  (cf.  'meat cooler'  in  American English); and  the word saabisu is used very differently  than  the  US  equivalent item  (in Japan  this  typically glosses  the  custom  of giving a regular  customer extra  attention  or  additional  products). Examples  of loan  blends  include itameshi for  'Italian  food' (meshiis 'food'  ); ton-katsu for 'pork cutlet'  (ton is 'pork'); doobutsu bisuketto for  'animal  biscuits' (doobustu is  'animal');  and ita-choko for 'chocolate  bar' (ita is a  'board'). A great number  of imported  nouns may also pair with Japanese verb suru ('to  do')  to construct  instant  hybrid  compounds (such  as tenisu-suru, or  'to  play tennis'), and  there  is a tendency  to  'verbalize'

English  nouns. This occurs in instances like makku-ru, which  combines  the Mc from  'McDonald's'  and  the Japanese verbal  ending -ru, rendering  something 'Mac-ing'  for  'going  to McDonald's'  (Yonekawa,  1999).

In  the Japanese-English  language  contact  situation,  both  loan  shifts  and loan translations are relatively infrequent.  Loan shifts, where native word  forms become  applied  to  borrowed  meanings  occur  when  the  meaning  of  some native  term  becomes  applied  to a foreign  (and  'new')  concept.  For  example, using ai ('love'  or  'affection') as  an  equivalent  to  iove'  in  the  English  T love you'  did  not  enter  the Japanese  sociolinguistic  register  until  recently. Loan  translations,  or  'caiques'  were  frequent  during  the  Second  World  War when  the  government  wanted  to  purge  the Japanese  language  of  foreign influences,  and  it  was  at  this  time  when  the  English-inspired sutoraiku ('strike')  was  replaced  by it  tama  ippon (see  Chapter  3  below).

At  this  stage  of  the  discussion,  two broad  points  may be  made.  First,  it seems  clear  that  there  is  only  a  partial  fit  between  the  traditional  view  of linguistic  borrowing  and  the Japanese  situation.  The  meanings  of Japanese English words are not so much borrowed from  abroad  as created,  negotiated, and  recreated within Japanese society. Japanese English words and phrases are often  utilized  for Japanese  aims and  purposes,  regardless  of  their  meanings in  the  donor  language. Second,  rather  than  regarding  these  as 'loanwords', it is more  appropriate  to consider  these  as 'English-inspired  vocabulary  items'. The term  'loanword' seems to imply a given fixed  structure and meaning which corresponds to an exact equivalent in the donor language. The alternative view of these as English-inspired vocabulary items opens a perspective which  creates a  space  for  the  creative  and  dynamic  dimensions  of  lexical  creation  (vs. loanword  acquisition)  in  this  context.

The  sociolinguistic  realities  underpinning  the  acquisition  and  use  of  this type of English  suggest  that many of these  'borrowed'  words and  phrases  are more accurately regarded  as Japanese  terms, on  a number  of different  levels. Many such  items represent  the feelings  of Japanese  speakers, and  thus  serve more to express the realities of contemporary Japanese culture than  to  import foreign  cultural concepts into Japan. Regardless of the fears of language  purists on  both  sides  of  the  Pacific,  there  is every  indication  that  the Japanese  and English  languages and  cultures will come  into increasing contact in  the years ahead.  In  this context,  language  and  cultural  change  appears  inevitable,  and such  patterns  of  change  find  linguistic  expression  in  the  hybrid  forms  of Japanese  English  that  we  have  discussed  in  this  chapter.

There  is strong  evidence  that English  now has a permanent  place  in  the linguistic  repertoire  of  the Japanese  people.  The  thousands  of  Englishinfluenced  vocabulary items that have entered  the Japanese language have had a  contemporary  influence  similar to that of the  Chinese  language  in  the  fifth century.  In  earlier  eras  of Japanese  history,  many  foreign  elements  were rapidly incorporated  in Japanese life and customs, and became nativized within

Japanese  culture. Today,  there  seems  to be  a surprising  lack  of  tension  between t h e s e  ' f o r e i g n ' ,  i.e.  English,  linguistic  items,  and  the  indigenous l a n g u a g e system, Japanese.  Not  least,  perhaps,  because  many  of  these  linguistic  items are  created  within Japan  and  within  the Japanese  cultural  and  linguistic  matrix. As  we  shall  soon  see, Japan  has  had  a  long  and  rich  tradition  of  linguistic contact,  and  this  is reviewed  in  some  detail  in  Chapter  3, which  follows.  Before proceeding,  however,  the  reader  is  now  invited  to  take  the  following  test  in Japanese  English,  which  is designed  for  the  non-Japanese  speaker  of  English.

- c. being  cross-eyed

A person  who  looks  towards  Paris  with  his  right  eye  and  towards  London with  his  left  is  b o u n d  to  have  eye  problems.  Thus,  a  person  who  is  cross› eyed  or  squints  is sometimes  said  to  be ron-pari.

2. baikingu ' Viking'

2. c.
3. first-run  films  showing  in  large  theatres

The  first-run  showing  of  a  new  film  in Japan  is  called  a roodoo shoo, by analogy  perhaps  with  plays  in  the  United  States  which  are  on  the  road before  they  arrive  on  Broadway.

8. sukin redii ' skin  lady'
- c. a  woman  selling  prophylactics  door  to  door

Women who sell condoms (kondoomu) door-to-door  are  called sukin rediisu. The  term  presumably  comes  from  the  brand  names  condoms  are  often given  in Japan  (e.g. Wrinkle  Skins,  Skin  Less  Skins, etc.).

11. kurisumasu keeki ' Christmas  cake'
- c. a  spinster

In Japan  it was  traditionally  believed  that  a woman  older  than twenty-five was  too  old  for  marriage.  Christmas  cakes  get  stale  after  25  December, hence kurisumasu keeki to  refer  to  an  unmarried  woman.  However,  today the  average  age for  marriage  for Japanese  women  is 27.5 years, so  this  term is  less  popular  than  previously.

12. konsento ' c o n s e n t ' ; ' c o n c e n t r i c ' c. an  electric  outlet

The  etymology  of  this  loanword  is  obscure.  Some  Japanese l o a n w o r d dictionaries  say  it  comes  from ' c o n c e n t r i c ' ,  t h e  shape  of  early  electric outlets.

13. sayoonara  hoomu  ran ' Sayonara  home  run' c. a  game-ending  baseball  home  run When  someone  hits a homer  into  the  stands  in  the  ninth  inning,  everyone

15. sukuramburu c. an  intersection  filled  with  pedestrians  going  every which  way

The  full  expression  is sukuramburu koosaten or  'scrambled i n t e r s e c t i o n ' (koosaten means  'crossroads,  intersection'  in Japanese).  This  is even  used in  official  documents,  and  appears  in  questions  in  written  driving  tests.

16. dorai ' dry'

c. a  person  who  is overly  business-like,  serious,  or  unsentimental

A  person  who  is a  cold  fish,  too  business-like,  too  serious,  or  too  distant, is said  to  be dorai in Japanese.  However,  this  term  and  the  next  now  seem to  be  decreasing  in  popularity.

17. uetto ' wet'
- c. a  person  who  is  overly  sentimental
3. 42 Japanese  English:  Language  and  culture  contact

The  opposite  of  Number  16  above,  of  course,  is  'wet'.  This  is  someone who  is  too  sensitive,  sentimental,  melancholy,  or  teary-eyed.

18. peepaadoraibaa

' p a p e r  driver' c. a  person  who  has  their  licence,  but  rarely  actually  drives Owning  a  car  in Japan  can  be  quite  troublesome,  especially  in  the  larger cities where  it is difficult  to have  a garage  or  find  somewhere  to  park.  Thus, many  people, young women  in  particular,  have  a driver's  licence  but  rarely use  it.

19. shirubaa shiito 'silver  seat' c. seats  on  buses  and  trains  reserved  for  the  elderly

' Silver'  has  become  a  metaphor  for  aging  in Japan  in  the  last  decade  or so.  Many  seats,  cards,  passes,  or  programmes  referring  to  the  elderly,  take t h e  prefix shirubaa.

20. dokku ' d o c k ' c. a  clinic

A  ship  gets  'dry-docked'  when  undergoing  maintenance;  hence,  by analogy,  clinics  can  also  be  termed dokku. For  example,  a ningen dokku, or  ' h u m a n  dock' (ningen means  'human  being'  in Japanese),  is a  complete and  thorough  physical  examination  given  at  the  hospital.

## Bonus question:

1. rimo  kon ' r e m o t e  control'
- a. a  piece  of  machinery  controlled  from afar
- b. a  television  selector  for  use  while  seated
- c. a  h u s b a n d  who  goes  straight  h o m e  after  work

All  three  answers  are  correct.  Answer  C  is  no  longer  as  prevalent  as  it  once was  as  more  and  more  Japanese  young  men  are  spending  time  with t h e i r families  after  work  rather  than  going  out  to  the  bars  with  their  co-workers. Thus,  returning  home  early is no  longer  quite  the  stigma  that  it was a few  years ago.  The  term rimo  kon now  is  especially  used  for  the  device  to  control t h e t e l e v i s i o n set  from a  c h a i r or  floor, if t h e t e l e v i s i o n is  in a t r a d i t i o n a l Japanese  room.

## Summary

In  this  chapter,  I have  set  out  to  establish  a framework  for  the  discussion  of Japanese  English  that  follows  in  subsequent  chapters. 10 In  particular,  I  have considered  the  occurrence  and  widespread  use  of Japanese English, particularly Japanese  English  lexical items, in everyday life in Japanese  society. In  order  to provide  the  reader  with  a broad  understanding  of the  status  and functions  of  Japanese  English  as a linguistic  resource,  I have also presented  a number  of detailed  examples  of language  use  to illustrate  the  ways in  which the  use  of English  contributes  to  the  'beautiful  human  life'  of  contemporary Japan,  drawn  from  the  worlds  of  advertising,  popular  music  and  the  sports commentaries.  The  overarching  argument  in  this chapter  is that  traditional approaches  to  linguistic  'borrowing'  and  English  'loanwords'  in Japan  are insufficient  to account for  the dynamics of  Japanese-English  language  contact, and  the varieties of  Japanese  English'  that have occurred  as the  result  of  this contact.  In  the  final  pages  of  the  chapter,  readers  are  invited  to  complete  a Japanese  English  test, which  illustrates in detail many of the  theoretical  issues that  have been  discussed.

## The  history of Japanese English language contact

## Introduction

Although  many  believe  that  extensive  contact  with  the  English  language  in Japan  first  began  with  the American  occupation  after  the  Second  World War, the  history  of Japanese  English  linguistic  contact  may be  traced  back  to  the early  seventeenth  century.  In  April  1600,  the  British  sailor  William  Adams (1564-1620), later  immortalized  as the  fictional John  Blackthorne  in James Clavell's bestselling  novel Shogun, came ashore  at Bungo  (present-day  Oooita Prefecture)  on  Kyushu island, aboard a Dutch ship. Adams eventually  became a diplomatic advisor and shipbuilder to the first shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and was given  a large  estate  near  present-day Yokotsuka  on  the  Miura  Peninsula. He  was  called  Miura  Anjin (Miura being  the  name  of  his  estate  and anjin meaning  pilot  or  navigator),  and  married  a Japanese  woman  (Blaker,  1932 [1973]). For a while, other British traders worked in Japan, usually with Adams as  their  agent.  However,  after  the  death  of  Ieyasu  in  1616,  the  days  of  the English  in Japan  were  numbered,  and  the  British  factory  at  Hirado  ceased operations  in  1623.

In  some  senses,  this  meeting  of  the  English  and Japanese  was  hardly remarkable,  for  language  contact  in Japan,  in  spite  of the  assumed  isolation of  the  islands,  had  repeatedly  occurred  throughout  early Japanese  history. Scholars  such  as  Loveday  call  this  a  'contact  tradition',  emphasizing  that, throughout  its  history, Japan  has  been  an  enthusiastic  borrower  of  things foreign,  including  the  linguistic  resources  of  foreign  languages  (1996:  27). Undoubtedly, the initial, and most important, contact was with Chinese at least 1600 years ago, in  the  fifth  century  AD. Buddhism,  brought  to Japan  through China  and  Korea,  inspired  Japanese  orthographic  resourcefulness and influenced  many aspects of  Japanese  society. Not only did  Chinese  contribute thousands  of loanwords  to the  language, it also gave Japanese  its first  writing system  as well as a scholarly  tradition  that  continues  to this day. At this  time, the  influence  of  Chinese  language  and  culture  was  established,  and  for centuries  the  official  language  of government  and  the  court was Chinese. 1

## Early language  contact  with  European  languages:  Portuguese,

## Spanish,  and  Dutch

The  first  Europeans  reached Japan  in  the  middle  of  the  sixteenth  century.  At had established  trading  posts  or  'factories'  from  Africa  to  the  East  Indies  (which i n c l u d e d  present-day  India  as  well  as  Malacca  and  Indonesia).  Portuguese t h e t h a t  t i me,  Portugal  was  the  leading  mercantile  nation  of  the  day  and merchant  sailors  led  by  Fernando  Mendes  Pinto  stepped  ashore  on southern  island  of  Kyushu  in  1544  (Milton,  2002).

The  Portuguese  brought  with  them  not  only European-style  mercantilism, but  also  Christianity,  which  was soon  established  in Japan  through  the efforts of  the  charismatic Jesuit  priest  Francisco  de  Xavier  and  his evangelical  mission. The  success  of  his  work  is  seen  by  the  fact  that  by  1600  probably  at  least  2 percent  of  the Japanese  population,  some  300,000,  had  been  converted  to Catholicism,  including  a  number  of  powerful daimyoo or  local  lords (Picken, 1983).  Portuguese,  Spanish  and  Latin  borrowings  were  not  uncommon  at  this t i m e ,  and  the  very  first  bilingual  dictionaries  and  grammars  of  Japanese appeared  at  this  time.  Portuguese  evidently  gave Japan  its  first  European loanwords,  many  of  which  are  still  in  use  today,  including  such  terms  as pan ( ' b r e a d ' &lt;  Portuguese pad), kappa ( ' r a i n c o a t , slicker'  &lt;  [derived f r o m ] Portuguese capa) , rasha ( ' c l o t h ' &lt;  Portuguese raxa), botan ( ' b u t t o n ' &lt; Portuguese botdo),  tempura ('food  fried  in  a batter'  &lt; Portuguese tempero),  shabon ('soap'  &lt; Portuguese sabdo) a n d  the  ubiquitous tabako ('tobacco'  &lt;  Portuguese tobaco) .  Estimates  are  that  some  200  to  400  of  such  terms  still survive  (Arakawa, 1931;  Loveday,  1996).

Some  of  the  processes  of  nativization  that  would  later  be  applied  to  other foreign  borrowings  began  to  be  seen  at  this  time. For  example,  the  term kappa ('slicker')  was  often  prefixed  with  the Japanese  word  for  'rain' (ame  Wi) to give ama-gappa (M # y / v ) ,  or  'raincoat' (now  a  'grandmother's  word' not used  by younger  generations.)  This  process  of  combining  a  loanword  with  a native Japanese  prefix  or  suffix  became  extremely  productive  as time  went  on. Other  Portuguese  examples  include  the  term  for  'glass  beads', biidama (\i-, a  c o mbination  of  the  Portuguese vidro ['flask,  glass']  and Japanese tama ['ball'  ^ ] ) .  T h e  word rasha ('cloth')  mentioned  above  has  also  undergone some  interesting  affixing  and  semantic  shifts.  A  term  which  became  popular in  t h e  l a t e  nineteenth  century  was rasha-men, ' c o t t o n cloth' ( ' c l o t h ' in Portuguese; rasha  "pis-V  , and Japanese  'cotton', menffi). However,  this  word does  not  refer  to  the  cloth  but  was  used  instead  to  describe Japanese  women who  consorted,  i.e.,  covered  themselves, with  foreign  men  (Ikawa,  2000).  The Spanish  loans were fewer,  but  some  are  still extant  including: meriyasu ('knitted fabric'  &lt; Spanish medias ' s t o c k i n g ' ) , kasutera ('sponge  cake',  &lt; Spanish Castilla, from  Castile),  and gerira ('guerilla'  &lt; Spanish guerrilla) (Okutsu  and  Tanaka, 1989;Kaieda,  1997).

By 1637, however,  the  Portuguese  and  Spanish  heyday was over.  Catholic missionaries  became  involved  in  numerous  intrigues with local warlords  and the  emerging  Japanese  central  government.  At  this  time,  many  of  the European  quarrels were spilling over into Asia and Japan. The fledging  central government  was also afraid  of  the  military  supplies  that  local warlords  were getting from  the  Portuguese  and  Spanish. Finally, in  disgust with  Portuguese and  Spanish  intrigues, Tokugawa  Ieyasu's son  Hidetada  banned  Christianity, killed  all Japanese  converts who would  not give up  the  religion,  and  expelled many of the  Europeans. The  exception was the  Dutch,  restricted  to the  small artificial  island  of Dejima  in  Nagasaki  Bay. Thus, officially  in  1633, almost  two centuries  of sakoku, self-imposed,  enforced  isolation,  began,  and  was  to  last well  into  the  nineteenth  century,  until  the  arrival  of  the  Americans  in  the 1850s.

The intrusion  of the Dutch  language into Japan was very important  to  the spread  of  English  several  centuries  later.  The  groundwork  for  Western scholarship and learning was established by Japanese scholars who studied  and translated  Dutch,  and  there  is little  doubt  that  the  story of English  in Japan would be vastly different  if not for  the presence  of Dutch  speakers, both  native and  foreign,  in  the  country.  The  period  of sakoku isolation  was never  total, and some contacts with the outside world persisted, especially with China  (Hall, 1970).  During  the  time  of sakoku, Dutch  was  the  only  European  language allowed to be studied in Japan, although  this was highly monitored.  Knowledge of  Dutch  was  restricted  to  the oranda-tsuuji ('Dutch  interpreters'),  the hereditary  interpreter  families  living  mostly in  Nagasaki  (Earns,  1993; Saito, 1967).

The  main  duties  of  the oranda-tsuuji were  two-fold:  First,  they  were responsible for overseeing the linguistic aspects of the trade between  the  Dutch and  the Japanese.  Dutch  ships came  about  twice a year and  these  translators acted  as customs officials  supervising  the  entry of people  and  goods.  Second, they  served  as  translators  for  Dutch  captains  during  their  annual  visits with the  shogun,  which  was an  important  opportunity  for Japanese  scholars  and the  government  to  gain  access  to  outside  information  on  world  affairs.  In addition,  although  this was not  an  official  responsibility,  they learnt  Western medicine  from  Dutch  doctors  from  discussions with  them  and  by  observing them  treat  their  patients  on  Dejima  Island.  Thus  began  the  field  known  as ran-gaku ('Dutch  Studies'), the study of Western  science and  medicine  during the sakoku isolationist  period  (Vos,  1963; Earns,  1993).

The  eighth  shogun  Tokugawa Yoshimune  (1684-1751)  lifted  some of  the sakoku restrictions in the mid-eighteenth  century, and Western books  imparting secular  knowledge  began  to be  imported  around  that  time. The  discipline  of ran-gaku (now  seen  as  'Western  studies')  expanded  both  in  terms  of  access and  subject  matter,  and  the  first  Dutch-Japanese  dictionary was compiled  in 1796.  Some  Dutch  on  Dejima  even  began  to  learn Japanese,  which  was  a

practice  forbidden  one  hundred  years  earlier.  Nonetheless,  the  learning  of Japanese  by the  Dutch  and  the  learning  of Dutch  by Japanese  remained  rather a  precarious  enterprise  subject  to  the  whims  and  sensitivities  of  the  local authorities.

Earns  (1993:  38,  citing  Saito,  1967)  claims  that  more  than  700  Dutch l o a n w o r d s  entered  Japanese  during  this  period  of  self-imposed isolation, although  others  assert  the  figure  was closer  to  3,000  (Sonoda,  1975).  Phonetic borrowings  were  particularly  common  during  this  period,  including: garasu ('glass'  &lt; Dutch glas),  biiru ('beer'  &lt; Dutch bier),  miruku ('milk'  &lt; Dutch melk), gomu ('rubber'  &lt; Dutch gom;  vlakgom, or  English  'gum'), renzu ('lens'  &lt;  Dutch lens) or koohii ('coffee'  &lt; Dutch koffie). Many  others  were  brought  in  through ' c a l q u i n g ' (or  'loan  translation').  For  example,  for  the  Dutch  term  for ' r e d wine' (mode  wijn), a  literal  translation  into Japanese  was  used: aka-budoo-shu (that  is,  'red'-  'grape'-  'alcohol').

A  n u m b e r  of  linguists  make  the  case  for  a  direct  Dutch  influence in Japanese  beyond  loanwords,  on  various  elements  in Japanese  grammar.  For example,  written Japanese  began  to  use  many  more  pronouns  like  'this'  and ' t h a t ' ,  o r  ' h e '  a n d ' s h e ' (kore and sore,  kare and kanojo) due  to  direct  translations from  Dutch  sentences,  although Japanese  is supposedly  comparatively  free  of pronouns  (Tsujimura,  1996).  The  relative  pronoun tokoro no is  t h o u g h t  to  be an  invention  by  Japanese  translating  Dutch  texts  (Miura,  1979a). One  example of  this  is  seen  in  the  sentence  below  from  the  1730s:

| koomoo-jin                                         | mochi-wataru                                       | TOKORO NO                                          | seizu . .      |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|

| 'The star chart, THAT the Dutch brought in, . . .' | 'The star chart, THAT the Dutch brought in, . . .' | 'The star chart, THAT the Dutch brought in, . . .' |                |
| (Earns, 1993: 53)                                  | (Earns, 1993: 53)                                  | (Earns, 1993: 53)                                  |                |

Many other  Dutch  grammatical  influences  on Japanese  can  also be  found, i n c l u d i n g  an  increased  use  of  inanimate  objects  as  sentence  subjects  and t he appearance  of  a  new  copula,  the  so-called de aru forms (Earns,  1993).  This last  case  is particularly  interesting.  Until  the  early  twentieth  century, Japan  was highly  'diglossic',  with  the  written  style,  using  erudite  classical Chinese expressions,  ancient  grammatical  forms,  and  often  obscure Sino-Japanese characters,  constituting  a very  different  language  than  the  spoken  vernacular. Learning  to  'write',  and  not just  acquiring  the  stroke  order  of  thousands  of i d e o g r a p h s ,  was  an  immensely  burdensome  task  (Twine,  1991).  When t h e oranda-tsuuji translators  found  that  there  was  little  difference  between  spoken Dutch  and  written  Dutch,  this  had  a  profound  impact.  Not  only  could  written texts  in  a  language  be  rendered  in  the  vernacular,  and  thus  become  accessible to  commoners,  but  when  they  translated  Dutch  into Japanese  they  did  so  in  a

comparably  plain  register  of Japanese,  an  innovation  that  shook  accepted literary  traditions. As Earns  points  out,  the  custom  of  using  a writing  style  close to  the  spoken  language  started  with  the oranda-tsuuji interpreters  in  Nagasaki. She  cites  several  examples  from  Sugimoto  (1983)  of oranda-tsuuji pondering which  style  to  use  to  translate  their  Dutch  works  into  Japanese:

When  translating  [this dictionary  into Japanese]  it is necessary  to use  words which are faithful  to the target language. The dictionary contains many vulgar words.  To  attempt  to  translate  them  into  an  elegant  language  is  not  only difficult,  but worse, it will ruin  the  nuances  of the  language.  [...]  Since  I am uneducated,  I cannot  translate  [the  Dutch  language]  by using  an  elegant choice  of words. If I am forced  to do so, I am  afraid  that  I will not  be  faithful to  the  meanings  of  the  original  language.  Therefore,  I do  not  mind  being laughed  at  by others,  but  I will  translate  by using  the  vulgar  dialect  of  my region.  (Sugimoto,  1983, cited  in  Earns,  1993: 80)

This  meant  that  colloquial  forms,  such  as  the de aru copula  or  the tokoro  no form  mentioned  above, were  used  by  the oranda-tsuuji to  directly  gloss  Dutch equivalents. As Western  learning  took  on  more  prestige  and  importance,  such styles  became  gradually  more  accepted,  and  Dutch  thus  contributed  directly to  the  written-language  reforms  in Japan  in  the  early  twentieth  century  (Twine, 1991). But,  more  importantly,  Dutch  learning  also  set  the  stage  for  both  the modernization  of  the  late  nineteenth  century,  and  the  impact  of  JapaneseEnglish  language  contact  at  that  time.

## Nineteenth-century Japanese  and  English  language  contact

In  the  seventeenth  century,  the  Dutch  outmanoeuvred  their  British  rivals  in gaining  political  and  economic  influence  with  the  shogunate  and other powerful  Japanese  forces,  although  eventually  nearly  all  Europeans  were expelled. 2 After  the  time  of  the sakoku seclusion,  English  was  probably  not heard  again  on  the  islands  for  around  two  hundred  years. The  re-opening  of the  islands  by the  American  commodore  Matthew  Perry  in  the  1850s,  however, was  not  the  first  occasion  when  English-speaking  Westerners  re-appeared  on t h e  shores  of  Japan.

In  1808,  during  the  time  of  the  Napoleonic  Wars,  the  English  ship  HMS Phaeton surreptitiously  entered  Nagasaki  harbour  flying  a  Dutch  flag.  The British  raided  the  Dutch  storehouse  on  Dejima  and  captured  several  Dutch residents  and  held  them  for  ransom  for  two days. The  magistrate  commissioner (bugyoo) of  Nagasaki,  Matsudaira Yasuhide,  committed  suicide  after  accepting responsibility  for  the  incident  and  the  local daimyoo l ord  was  placed  under house  arrest  (Hall,  1970). More  importantly,  this incident  revealed  the  growing weakness  of  the  Tokugawa  shogunate  which  had  ruled Japan  for  two  centuries, and  foreshadowed  the  coming  of  the  Americans  forty  years  later.

This  foreign  affairs  crisis  caused  the  shogun  to  re-evaluate  its  language policy.  Six oranda-tsuuji in  Nagasaki  were  ordered  to  immediately begin studying  English  under  the  tutelage  of Jan  Cook  Blomhoff,  the  Englishspeaking  Dutch  head  assistant  at  Dejima.  Later  French  and  Russian  were added,  and  most  interpreters  had  to  study  at  least  three  languages  (Doi,  1976: 32).  French  was taught  by Hendrik  Doeff,  the  head  of  the  Dejima  trading  post. Although  at  first  there  were  no  materials  to  use  for  study,  the oranda-tsuuji produced  a  remarkable  output  of materials  in  a short  period  of  time. The  first English  grammars were written  in  1810 and  1811, and  in  1814 the  first  EnglishJapanese  dictionary  was  compiled  with  some  6,000  entries  (Doi,  1976).  The missionary  Walter  Henry  Medhurst  wrote  his An  English and  Japanese and Japanese  and  English  Vocabulary in  1830 while  in  the  Dutch  East  Indies,  and  the oranda-tsuuji soon  acquired  access  to  this.

Perhaps  the  most  colourful  of  the  Western  adventurers  who  visited  the islands  in  the  mid-nineteenth  century  was  Ranald  MacDonald,  who  reached Japan,  in  1848.  Born  in  1824  in  Oregon,  MacDonald  (1824-94)  was  the  son of a Hudson's  Bay Company  trader  and  a Native American  mother.  MacDonald claimed  that  he  was  drawn  to Japan  in  spite  of  the  obvious  dangers  of  such  a venture:

I resolved within myself, to personally solve the mystery  [of who the Japanese were, and why they had  built a wall around  their country], if possible, at any cost or  effort  - yea life  itself. Mad! or  not - I did  so - at least in  measure of my aim  and  power.  (Lewis and  Murakami,  1990: 121)

MacDonald's  plan was innocent  in its simplicity. He  signed  onto  a whaling  ship, and  asked  to  be  sent  adrift  in  a  small  lifeboat  about  five  miles  off  the  coast  of Hokkaido,  in  the  far  north  of Japan.  In  his  possession  were  provisions  for  a month,  a  small  bible,  and  an  English  grammar  and  dictionary.  On  27  J u n e 1848,  he  reached  Yankeshiri  Island  and  later  proceeded  to  Rishiri  Island.

Under  the  strict  laws  of  the  shogunate  MacDonald  was  imprisoned,  even t h o u g h  he  claimed  that  he  had  drifted  into  the  country  by accident.  However, he  taught  English  to  fourteen oranda-tsuuji in  Nagasaki,  and  was  treated  well there. The  interpreters,  it appears, were  overjoyed  at gaining  access  to a  'native speaker'  of English. After  a year,  in  1849, he was sent  back  to  the  United  States along  with  other  thirteen  American  deserters  who  were  held  in  Dejima  by  the Japanese.  However,  he  left  an  impressive  if  under-appreciated  legacy.  Two  of his  students,  Moriyama  Einosuke  and  Hori  Tatsunosuke,  later  acted as i n t e r p r e t e r s  during  Commodore  Perry's  second  visit  to Japan  in  1854,  and  a third  student,  Nomura  Tsunenosuke, was the  interpreter  for  the  first Japanese delegation  to  the  United  States  in  1860.  Hori  Tatsunosuke  later  went  on  to edit A  Pocket Dictionary of  the English-Japanese Language in  1862  (a  thousandpage  tome)  at  the  government's Bansho-Shirabe-sho ' S c h o o l  for  European Languages'  (see  Table  3.1  below).

As  noted  in  Table  3.1  above,  one  of  the  first  translation  bureaux  was  the Official  Office  for  the  Translation  of  Barbarian  Books  into Japanese,  which later  became  the  School  for  European  Languages. This was established  in  1811 soon  after  the Phaeton arrived  in  Nagasaki  Bay,  causing  all  kinds  of  panic.  The Tokugawa  government  set  up  the  institute  to  study  the  main ' b a r b a r i a n ' l a n g u a g e s ,  English,  French,  Russian  and  Dutch,  in  an  effort  to  be  able  to negotiate  equally  with  the  foreigners  then  intruding  into Japan.  The  bureau was  located  in  Edo,  close  to  Nagasaki.  Formal  schooling  was  rare  during  this t i me,  often little  m o r e  t h a n  what  was  provided  at  the  local terakoya, single t e a c h e r  classes  often  held  in  private  residences,  so  a  government-sponsored institution  for  studying  foreign  languages  was  a  significant  innovation.  The changing  attitudes  towards  the  European  languages  are  reflected  in  the  various names  given  this  school  over  time.  In  its  early  years,  this  academy  studied ' b arbarian  books', while  at  the  end  of  the  Tokugawa  in  the  late  1860s, the  study of Western  languages  was conducted  at  an  'institute  of  progress'.  By the  1870s t h e  l a n guages  included  English,  French,  German,  Russian,  and  Chinese.  By this  time,  Dutch  was  no  longer  taught,  and  Korean  was  transferred  to  Tokyo Commercial  School  (later  to  become  Hitotsubashi  University) (Doi,  1976). Eventually,  this foreign  language  school  combined  with  Tokyo  Medical  College to  form  Tokyo  University  -  the  most  prestigious  university  in Japan  today.

Nakahama  Manjiro  (1827-98),  a  fisherman  from  Tosa-han (present-day Kochi-ken)  in  Shikoku  island  was another  unusual  character  who  contributed to  the  spread  of  English  in Japan.  In  1841  the  fourteen-year-old  Nakahama was in  a  shipwreck,  but  was  rescued  by an  American  whaler  and  taken  back  to t h e  United  States.  He  remained  there  for  ten  years,  went  to  school,  and acquired  a near-native  command  of English,  as well as the American  nickname ' J o h n ' .  Upon  his  return  to Japan,  he  was  made  an  honorary  samurai  due  to his  English  ability,  and  taught  English  at  the  government  institute  mentioned above.  When  Commodore  Perry  arrived  in Japan,  he  was  summoned  to  Edo to  serve  the Japanese  government  as an  interpreter,  but  his services were  never used,  presumably  because  his  loyalty was  suspect,  having  been  in  the  United States  for  so  long  (Kaneko,  1956;  Ike,  1995;  Earns,  1993).  However,  class differences may  have  played  a  role  here  as  well,  a  fisherman's son,  J o h n Manjiro  never  was  an  insider  among  the  ruling  elite  or  samurai  class, and  an audience  before  the  shogun  for  such  a  person  -  regardless  of  his  English ability  -  would  have  been  exceptional.  Nevertheless,  the  books  he  brought to Japan  with  him  from  America  (especially  his Webster's English Dictionary) formed  the  basis  of  the Genkai, a  major Japanese  dictionary  of  the  Meiji  Period (Earns,  1993).

## Commodore  Perry  and the politics of  English in  nineteenth-century Japan

In  1853  Commodore  Perry  came  to Japan  with  a  squadron  of  ships,  thus starting  the  American  Pacific  colonization  process  which  continued  well  into

the  twentieth  century.  Ostensibly,  the  mission  was  to  pressure Japan  into joining  the  world  of  'civilized  nations'; but  Perry also wanted  to gain  trading concessions,  create  opportunities  to proselytize,  and  extract  a safe  haven  for

American  whaling ships to replenish  (Neumann,  1963).

The Kanagawa Treaty of 1854 and  the Ansei Commercial Treaties of  1858 officially  and  effectively  ended  the sakoku isolation  period.  Because  of 'Kanagawa', Americans were granted  most-favoured-nation  trading status,  the use  of  two  ports  (Shimoda  and  Hakodate)  as supply  stations,  hospitality  for shipwrecked American sailors, and the right to open a consul in Shimoda.  The 'Ansei  (Five  Power)  Treaties',  between Japan  and  the  United  States,  Great Britain, Russia, France, and  the Netherlands, set tariff  rates, established  official diplomatic  relations,  and  institutionalized  extraterritoriality  for foreign nationals. After  the  reopening  of Japan  in  the  1850s, the  linguistic  landscape soon changed. The Kaisei-sho ('Institute  for  Translation  and  Foreign  Studies') began  to enthusiastically support English in its curriculum  from  1856 onwards. The Kaisei-sho 's  first  English-Japanese  dictionary  was  published  in  1862 (Fukuhara,  1958).

The  open-port  treaties  allowed  Westerners  access  to Yokohama  and Nagasaki,  and  foreign  residents  began  moving  in. To deal with  this  influx  of foreigners,  the Japanese  government  opened  two  new  foreign language schools,  one  in  Edo  in  1856  (where John  Nakahama  taught)  and  one  in Nagasaki  in  1858. The  Edo  school  had  only Japanese  interpreters,  while  the Nagasaki  school  included  native  speakers  of English,  as well  as French  and Russian  (Earns,  1993). But it was soon clear that English was the major  foreign language necessary for both commerce and modernization. The rise of English was  influenced  by  the  politics  of  the  day.  Many Japanese  felt  the  treaties granted  foreigners  under American  pressure were unequal  and  humiliating. To implement  them,  the Tokugawa shogunate  had  to purge  over a  hundred government  officials,  placing  them  under  house  arrest,  forcing  them  into retirement,  or  executing  them. 3 Such  conflicts  contributed  to  the  fall  of  the Shogunate  government  in  1867.

The  'inequality'  of  the  treaties  with  Western  powers was also  paralleled by linguistic  matters. As the  transition  from  Dutch  to  English  was not  easy, Dutch continued to  be  used in all  official  Japanese government communications  for  quite  some  time,  even  after  the  arrival  of  Commodore Perry. 4 All  treaties were written  in Japanese,  Dutch,  and  the  language  of  the Western  nation  involved,  but  the  authoritative  version  of  a  treaty  was  the language  of  the  American  and  European  powers  (Earns,  1993). This  led  to some  serious  problems.  For  example,  in  the  Kanagawa  Treaty  presented  by Perry in  1854, it w r as stated  that:

There shall be appointed by the government of the United States consuls or agents  to reside  in  Shimoda,  at any time after  the  expiration  of  eighteen months from  the date of the signing of the treaty; provided that either of the two

governments deem such arrangements necessary (emphasis  added;  cited  in  Earns,

1993:247).

The  italicized  clause  above  was  mistranslated  by  the Japanese  to  mean t h a t both g o v e r n m e n t s  had  to  agree  to  establish  a  consulate,  and  were  thus  rather shocked  by the  sudden  arrival  in  August  1856  of Townsend  Harris  (1804-78), t h e  first  American  diplomatic  envoy  permanently  assigned  to Japan.

Poor  interpretation  also caused  other  problems for Japan  in  its  interactions with  the  Western  powers.  In  September  1854,  Sir James  Stirling  representing the  interests  of  Great  Britain  (which  had just  become  involved  in  the  Crimean War)  went  to  Nagasaki  in  an  attempt  to  deny  Russian  ships  access  to  the  port. He  had  great  difficulty  making  himself  understood  because  he  had  no  efficient i n t e r p r e t e r ,  and  it  was  unclear  to  the Japanese  exactly  what  he  wanted. In despair,  the  Nagasaki  officials  offered  him  the  same  terms  that  had  been  given to  Perry  six  m o n t h s  earlier,  which  Stirling  accepted  in  the  belief  that ' a foothold  in Japan,  no  matter  how  limited,  was worth  having'  (Beasley,  1950: 29). At a stroke,  Stirling  had  opened Japan  to  Great  Britain  on  the  same  terms as  the  USA,  the  advantages  of  which  would  become  apparent  in  the  coming decades  of  the  Meiji  Period.

Politically,  the  lessons  from  China,  India,  Indonesia,  and  elsewhere  were clear  to  the Japanese:  if  left  to  their  own  devices, Westerners  would  carve  up Japan just  as they  had  done  in  other Asian  countries.  The  results of  the  Second Opium  War  in  China  caused  great  consternation  among Japanese  politicians and  intellectuals.  Townsend  Harris  exacerbated  these  fears  when  he  implied t h a t  t h e  1862  peace  settlement  in  China,  the  Treaty  of  Tientsin,  would free up  the  British  and  French  fleets  and  forces  to  invade Japan  if  negotiations with  America  did  not  go  well.  The  impact  of  the  new  treaties  on  everyday  life was  still  unknown.  Would  the  new  foreigners  bring  economic  prosperity,  as they  promised,  enchanting  goods  and  knowledge  from  afar,  or  simply  the foreign  domination  of  a  severely weakened Japanese  nation?

At  this  time,  many Japanese  were  repeating naiyuu gaikan ('troubles  at home,  and  dangers  from  abroad'),  a  Chinese  expression  predicting t h e collapse  of  a  dynasty.  Indeed,  by  the  mid-nineteenth  century  the  Tokugawa government,  which  had  maintained  peace  and  order  in Japan  for  two  and  half centuries,  was  facing  serious  internal  and  external  challenges.  One solution was  to  meet  the  West  head-on  and  modernize  the  country,  and  for t h a t enterprise,  knowledge  of Western  customs  and  science was necessary.  The  only way to acquire  this knowledge  was to master  their  languages, especially  English. Previous experts  in  'Dutch  studies'  now switched  quickly to English, for  reasons clearly  given  by  Fukuzawa Yukichi  in  his  famous  autobiography:

One  day  [in  1858]  I went  to Yokohama  for  sight-seeing  . .  . the  pioneer [foreign]  merchants  were  living  [there]  and  showing  their  wares.  To  my chagrin, when  I tried  to speak  to  them,  no  one  seemed  to understand  me  at

all.  Nor  was I able  to  understand  anything  spoken  by a single  one  of all  the foreigners  I met.  Neither  could  I read  anything  of  the  signboards  over  the shops. Nor  the  labels on  the  bottles which  they had  for  sale. There  was not  a single recognizable word in any of the inscriptions or in any speech.  It  might have been  English  or French  for  aught  I knew  . . . [One  shopkeeper  named Kniffer]  could  somehow understand  my Dutch when  I put it in writing.  . . .  I had  been  walking for  twenty-four  hours, a distance  of some  fifty  miles,  going and  coming. But the fatigue  of my legs was nothing compared with the  bitter disappointment  in my heart.  I had  been  striving with all my powers for  many years  to  learn  the  Dutch  language. And  now when  I had  reason  to  believe myself one  of the  best in  the  country,  I found  that  I could  not  even  read  the signs of merchants who had  come  to trade with us from  foreign  lands. It was a bitter  disappointment,  but I knew it was no  time to be downhearted.  Those signs  must  have  been  . . .  in  English  . . . for  I had  inklings  that  English  was the  most  widely  used  language.  A  treaty  with  the  two  English-speaking countries  had just  been  concluded. As certain  as day, English  was to  be  the most  useful  language  of  the  future.  I realized  that  a man  would  have  to  be able to read and  converse in English to be recognized  as a scholar in Western subjects  in  the  coming  time.  In  my disappointment  my spirit was low, but  I knew that it was not the  time  to be sitting still.  (Fukuzawa,  1899  [I960]: 97-8)

Fukuzawa Yukichi  (1835-1901)  was one  of the  most  outstanding  men  of  letters in  Meiji Japan  in  the  last  half  of  the  nineteenth  century,  and  was a  founder  of Keio University.  During  his lifetime,  he was recognized  as an  important  theorist on Japanese  modernization,  and  was a member  of the  first Japanese  delegation to  the  United  States  in  1860.  Later,  however,  he  discovered  that  English  was not  quite  as  foreign  as  he  had  first  believed:

After  a while we came to see that English was a language not so entirely  foreign to  us  as we  had  thought.  Our  fear  in  the  beginning  that  we were  to  find  all our labor and  hope expended  on Dutch to have been spent in vain, and  that we were  to  go  through  the  same  hardship  twice  in  our  lives proved  happily wrong.  In  truth,  Dutch  and  English  were  both  'languages  written  sideways' of  the  same  origin.  Our  knowledge  of  Dutch  could  be  applied  directly  to English; our one-time fear was a groundless illusion.  (Fukuzawa,  1899  [I960]: 103)

Before  the  arrival  of  the  Americans,  there  were  already  many  signs  of domestic  malaise. A major  famine  in  the  1830s  had  spurred  peasant  uprisings and  unrest,  and  the  economy  was  in  disarray  (Hane,  1982).  When Perry demanded  a  treaty,  the  shogun  could  not  reach  a  consensus  among  the  local daimyoo l o r d s  about  what  to  do.  Many  influential l e a d e r s ,  like  Fukuzawa, sincerely believed  in  the  superiority  of at least certain  Western  practices.  Others like  Sakuma  Shozan  advocated Tooyoo no  dootoku,  seiyoo no gaku-gei ('Eastern ethics,  Western  science'),  believing  in  the  acquisition  of  Western  knowledge to  know  one's  enemy  (Beasley,  1990).

Some Japanese, however, were committed xenophobes who saw the  influx of foreigners  in  the  country after  the  three  ports of Yokohama, Nagasaki,  and Hakodate were opened  in  1859 as nothing short of a disgrace. Cries of Sonnoo jooi ('Revere  the Emperor,  expel the barbarians')  became heard  on  the  streets more  and  more. Increased  foreign  trade  raised  the  price  of local goods  even higher.  When  the  shogun  tried  to  use  force  to  limit  the  activities  of  the Westerners, the Japanese  military was humiliated.  The Tokugawa  government seemed  unable  to meet  the Western  threat  either  militarily or  diplomatically, and  internal  civil  rebellions  broke  out.  The  Tokugawa  shogunate  sought  to strengthen  its  position  by  seeking  out  Western  economic  and  military assistance, and  intensifying  diplomatic  and  cultural  exchanges. This  increased contact  with  foreigners,  however,  destroyed  the  last  vestiges  of  Tokugawa legitimacy,  and  in January  of  1868 a new government  was established  in  the name of the Meiji  emperor.

English,  enlightenment,  and  language contact

The  Meiji  Restoration (Meiji  Ishin) changed  Japan  completely,  almost overnight.  The  old  caste  distinctions  of  samurai-townsman-farmer were abolished  and  a  new,  stronger,  central  government  was  established. Compulsory education was started; a military draft was enacted; a constitutional monarchy authorized.  Thus began  the  Meiji  Enlightenment (Bummei  kaika), a concerted  effort  by the new government  to instantly modernize  the  country.

There were also a number of important changes in language policies. The study of Dutch  and  English had  previously been  a rather  controlled  affair  that was  usually  restricted  to  civil  servants  for  official,  scientific  and  political purposes. Throughout  the late nineteenth  century, however, private  language academies  blossomed.  The  language  monopoly  held  by  the  authorities completely  disappeared,  and  more  and  more  commoners  could  acquire knowledge  of foreign  languages. Nevertheless, as Loveday  (1996)  points  out, Dutch  continued  to  hold  high  status  in  the  minds  of  many Japanese,  and although  English was intended  to be the compulsory foreign  language  in  the new public educational system, no one had the linguistic or financial  resources to  implement  such  a programme.  At first,  the  only  real  students  to  receive adequate  training in English were children  of the upper  classes who  attended schools  where  English  was  often  the  medium  as  well  as  the  subject  of instruction  (ibid.).  The  common  folk  -  the  merchants,  shopkeepers,  and members of the entertainment quarters - were left  to their own devices. They had  to improvise when  they met foreign  sailors and  businessmen  in  everyday situations in  the newly opened  international  ports of Yokohama and  Nagasaki. To  communicate  with  each  other,  the  hosts  and  their  guests  developed  a pidginized  version  of Japanese  English,  the  'Yokohama  Dialect',  which  was named  after  the  major  seaport where  much  of this early contact  took  place. 5

From  1859, Yokohama was the first Japanese  port  opened  to world  trade, and  was  'a  meeting  place  for  merchants,  sailors,  missionaries, drifters, adventurers,  and  globetrotters  from  a  score  of  nations'  who  mingled  with 'vendors, jugglers,  samurai,  farmers,  [and]  girls  in  bright  kimonos,  many  of them  drawn  from  Tokyo  or  even  points  farther  to  do  business,  shop,  and observe  the  odd  behavior  of the foreigners  who  [had]  torn  their  nation  from seclusion' (Rosenstone,  1988:  11).  It  soon  became  home  to  some 1,500 Westerners, 3,000  Chinese, and  25,000 Japanese,  and  a community  served by 4 newspapers,  2 hospitals,  3 churches,  a cricket  pitch,  a racecourse,  a  men's club, a theatre, and various other  kinds of establishments, public  and  private. It  was  the  scene  of  'solid  investment  and  high  risk  enterprise,  of  major European  trading agencies and shady firms that spring up one week and vanish the  next' (ibid.:  10).  The  Yokohama  of  the  day  was  as  expensive  as contemporary  New York. 6

The Yokohama  Dialect  (are other Japanese  English  pidgins)  died  out  in the  twentieth  century,  and  we must  now  rely  on  written  sources  to  see  how everyday Japanese  and  foreigners  communicated.  Fortunately, we have  been left  with  a few documents, albeit rather  obscure and  rare, which  indicate  how this speech  may have sounded.  One of the chief sources for  this pidgin  comes from  a 32-page  pamphlet written  by Hoffman  Atkinson,  a long-term  resident in  the  Yokohama  foreign  settlement.  The  pamphlet,  humorously  entitled 'Exercises  in  the  Yokohama  Dialect',  appeared  in  various  sanctioned  and pirated  editions  through  the  early  1900s. It was first  published  in  1874,  and was revised in  1879 under  the title  'Revised and Enlarged  Edition  of  Exercises in  the Yokohama Dialect'. Most editions give no date, place of publication,  or author.  Vos  (1963)  and  Williams  (1963)  cite  the  author  as  the  'Bishop  of Homoco', an  inside joke  for  local foreign  residents (hamakko being  standard

Japanese  slang  at  the  time  for  'a  real Yokohaman'). The  copy  Daniels  (1948) examined  was  dated  1915,  and  he  claims  that  some  21,000  copies  were allegedly  printed.  (The  copy  I  cite  below  is apparently  from  1879.) 7

The  most  remarkable  feature  of  the  Atkinson  text  is  that  the  Japanese ' t r a n s c r i p t i o n s '  a r e  d e s i g n e d  to  resemble  English  as much  as possible,  resulting in  many  (probably  intentionally)  humorous  correlates,  as  seen  in  Table  3.2 above. According  to  Daniels  (1948: 806), who  made  a  study  of  the  vocabulary i t e m s  in  Atkinson,  about  80  to  85  percent  of  the  words  used  came from Japanese.  Adachi's  dictionary  (1988)  suggests  that  this  percentage  may  have even  been  higher.  Many  terms were  straightforward  names  for  everyday  objects (e.g., mado ' window'),  numerals  (e.g., ichi ' o n e ' ) ,  colours  (e.g, akai ' r e d ' ) ,  verbs (e.g., arau ' t o  wash')  or  c o m m o n  adjectives  (e.g., muzukashii ' difficult').  None of  the  standard  Japanese  inflections  were  used,  however.  The  second  most frequent  source  language  was English, followed  by a few forms  that were  extant in  other  English-based  pidgins  in  Asia  at  this  time.  However,  the  English  that was  contributed  is fascinating,  and  shows  much  of  the  linguistic  and  cultural life  in  Meiji Japan.  There  are  many  straightforward  borrowings,  especially  for those  things  related  to  the  foreign  community,  for  example, consul,  curio, or hotel, a l t h o u g h  many  of  these  terms  had  undergone  various  semantic  shifts. For  example,  the  term house could  mean  'home  or  place  of  origin',  'residence or  building',  or  'store  or  place  of  business'.

The  term  'curios'  is  often  mentioned  in  the  Atkinson  text,  and  a  few additional  comments  about  this  term  might  be  germane  at  this  point  as  it reflects  much  about  the  culture,  as  well  as  the  language  contact  situation  at this  time.  'Curios'  or  'things Japanese'  were  now  becoming  quite  popular  in the  United  States. For  example,  Neumann  describes  how  the  fad  for  Japanese items  affected  shopping  habits  of  East  Coast Americans  in  the  late  nineteenth century:

A display of  Japanese  'curios' at the  Philadelphia  Exhibition  in  1876 aroused so  much  interest  that  the  following  year  Tiffany  and  Company offered Americans  a large  selection  of articles  purchased  for  this  new market. Also, in  1877 a Japanese  company  devoted  to  the  encouragement  of  native  arts opened  a branch  in New York to cater to the American  connoisseurs who  had developed  a taste for Japanese  creations.  (Neumann,  1963: 64)

English  also  sometimes  inadvertently  contributed  vocabulary  when Japanese  speakers  borrowed  words  for  Western  objects,  on  the  basis  of  their observation  of  the  foreigners'  speech  habits;  for  example,  the  term for European  dogs  became kameya or komiya, because Japanese  people  supposedly heard  Americans  say 'Come  here!'  to  their  dogs  (Diosy,  1879; cf.  Miura,  1983). Adachi  (1988)  discusses  at  some  length  this  'semantic  redefinition', arguing

t h a t  t he  term  was  heard  by Japanese  as  'Come  here'  plus -ya, a ' s e n t i m e n t a l particle'  used  to  indicate  closeness.  Thus, kameya was t h o u g h t  to  be  a  ' Western breed  of  dog'  + ya. The  term kame, t h e n ,  became  used  for  any  Western or foreign  dog  in  the Yokohama  Dialect,  and  also  for  'mutt'  in Japanese,  at  least in  some  dialects,  such  as  the  Tohoku  dialect  (Arakawa,  1984).  Both  Atkinson and  Diosy  cite  the  term  for  a  British  or  American  sailor  as dam  your  eye sto or damuraisu h'to, from  the  English  phrase  'Damn  your  eyes!'  plus  the  Japanese word  for  person, hito. Again,  this  phrase  no  doubt  came  from  overhearing  the seamen's  vernacular  speech.

As  in  many  language  contact  situations,  semantic  modification is noticeable  in  the Yokohama  Dialect.  Often  the  meanings  associated  with  a  term of Japanese  origin  was extended.  For  example, aboorak (&lt; Japanese abura, ' oil') was  used  to  refer  to  butter,  oil,  kerosene,  grease,  and  lamp  oil.  Another example  of semantic  extension  is seen  in  the Japanese  word sake ('rice  wine'). This  term  was  extended  to  any  alcoholic  beverage: beer sacky for ' b e e r ' , ah-kye sacky  (akai  sake, ' r e d  sake')  for  claret,  or square-face sacky for  'gin'  ('square  face' being  common  sailors'  slang for  the  gin  bottle  and  its contents).  'Champagne' is  given  by  Diosy  (1979)  as pom  sacky; a l t h o u g h  he  suggests  no  derivation  for it,  this  term  may  have  come  from  the  standard Japanese ponpon (' b a n g ' ) or pon-to ('with  a  p o p ' T$&gt; h).

The Yokohama  Dialect  died  out  for  several  reasons,  three  of which  I  think are  most  important.  First,  the  sheer  number  of  English-speaking foreigners in Japan  increased  exponentially  in  the  last quarter  of  the  nineteenth  century. This  made  them  the  dominant  economic  force,  especially  in  certain  areas,  of t h e  port  cities.  Second,  standard  English  increased  in  prestige  while  that  of the  Yokohama  Dialect  sank.  English  replaced  Dutch  as  the  language  to  learn about  the  West,  and  ambitious  young  Japanese  civil  servants,  diplomats, scientists,  and  scholars were  anxious  to  learn  it. At  the  same  time,  the  speakers of  t h e  Yokohama  Dialect,  mere  merchants,  traders,  entertainers, a n d courtesans, were  dismissed  by the  newly disenfranchised  samurai  and  educated classes  as  second-class  citizens  of  little  merit  or  status.  Finally,  there  was  direct and  indirect  government  support  for  the  learning  of  English.  The Meiji administration  brought  in  a  whole  cadre  of  'foreign  experts'  to  instantly modernize  the  country.  These  included  many  official  teachers  of  English,  as well  as  others  who  offered  their  linguistic  expertise  for  fee  or  favour.

However  obscure  the Yokohama  Dialect  may be  today,  its legacy  persisted for  some  time.  For  example,  items  that  continued  to  be  used  well  into t h e 1920s  included: suto ('stove'), hausu ( ' h o u s e '  as  mentioned  above), pairo ('pilot'), basuke ('basket'), bisuke ('biscuit'), wada ('water'), tomura ('tomorrow') (Sonoda,  1975; Adachi,  1988).

## Other  contact  varieties  and Japanese  varieties  of  English

There  is no  doubt  that  other  kinds  of  restricted  languages  (or  'pidgins')  were extant  throughout  the  late  nineteenth  century.  Loveday  (1996) mentions several,  including  'nurse-talk' (ama-kotoba), ' merchant  talk' (shoonin-kotoba), ' driver-talk' (kurumaya-kotoba), ' b r o t h e l  talk' (chabuya-kotoba), and  'sailor  talk' ( madorosu-kotoba) . a Another  example  was  found  in  the  foreign  churches  and i n t e r n a t i o n a l  schools,  a  type  of  speech  that  Smout  (1988)  terms ' missionary English'.  A  version  of  English  was  also  developed  by  the  early  Japanese translators  themselves,  with  the  help  of  textbooks  or  Dutch  speakers,  called ' I n t e r p r e t e r ' s  English'  (Adachi,  1988). 9 Also, as  discussed  earlier,  in  1811  (not long  after  the  HMS Phaeton's intrusion  into  Dejima  harbour  in  Nagasaki  Bay), Nagasaki tsuuji i n t e r p r e t e r s  compiled  what  was  probably  the  first  Englishl a n g u a g e t e x t b o o k in  J a p a n .  The  phrases  often s o u n d  quaint,  even by nineteenth-century  standards,  as  the  following  example  shows  (Earns,  1993: 146):

The winter  doth  not  please  me Ware wafuyu  o konomazu (I  don't  like  winter.)

Soon  after  contact  with  the  Americans  began,  an  1859  book,  entitled A  New Familiar  Phrases  of the English  and Japanese  Languages General  Use  for  the  Merchant of  the  Both  Countries  first  parts  Nagasaky Sixth Year of Ansay  December 1859, was apparently  commissioned  by the  government  for  use  by Japanese  and  English speaking  merchants  (Earns,  1993).  Certain  peculiarities  in  style would  appear in  this,  such  as  translating  all  English  sentences  into  active  forms,  even  when they  were  originally  passive,  as  in  the  example  below  (Earns,  1993:  148):

That will be  done  with Japanese  letters.

Nihon  moji de yoroshii (It will be  good  with Japanese  letters.)

After  the  period  of  isolation  ended  in  the  1860s,  the  Meiji  government, in  its  efforts  to  modernize  the  country,  strived  to  adopt  Western institutions immediately.  The  influx  of  British  and  American  technical  advisors,  teachers, and  missionaries  gave  the  English  language  a  high  level  of  prestige,  and studying  it had  immediate  practical  applications.  It became  fashionable  among Japanese  students  and haikara people  ('high  collar'  sophisticates who  emulated Western  ways)  to  intersperse  their  daily  conversation  with  English  borrowings. For  example,  one  might  consider  the  conversation  of Meiji  university  students on  p.  61, taken  from  an  1875  novel  and  cited  in  Takahashi  (1967)  and  Sonoda (1975).  I  have  numbered  the  sentences  to  make  comparisons  between t h e Japanese  and  English  translations  easier,  but  it is actually  a monologue  written sequentially:

- (i Wagahai  no uocchi dewa  mada ten  minyuttsu gurai.
- (2 Webster no  daijiten -jitsu-ni  kore wa yuusufuru ja.
- (3 Chotto sono bukku o misete kurenka.
- (4 fitsu-ni nihonjin no anpankucharu niwa  osore  iru.
- (5 Moriyama-kun purei suru-ka.
- (6 Ningen no  tanoshimi wa  ani sekkusu nomi naruya.
- (V Fragility. The  name  is  woman.
- (8 That is.  Kuwashiku ieba neemuri.  Raten de ieba id  est.
- (9 Moo  hitosu  ieba to wit.
- (1 By my watch there  is still ten minutes.
- (2 This 'Webster's Comprehensive  Dictionary'  is really useful.
- (3 Can  I take  a look  at  that book for  a  moment?
- (4 I'm  sick of these Japanese  being  so unpunctual.
- (5 Does Moriyama  [go to the  gay quarters  to] play [around],  too?
- (6 Man's only pleasure  is sex.
- (7 Fragility [sic,  'frailty'  from  Hamlet,  Act I, Scene  1] thy name is woman.
- (8 That is, to  say it precisely, namely, id est in Latin.
- (9 In  other  words, to wit. (Takahashi,  1967: 79-80; Sonoda,  1975:  16-7)

It  was  about  this  time  that  certain  linguistic  attitudes  were  forming  in  the minds  of  both Japanese  and  foreigners  concerning  the  language  of  choice  to be  used  in  their  mutual  attempts  at  cross-linguistic  communication.  With  the increased  contact  with  the  West  in  the  late  nineteenth  century,  an  increased use  of  English  by Japanese  was  an  inevitability.  As  the  new  government  made ties  with  America  and  Europe,  more  and  more  foreigners  came  to Japan  as traders,  sailors,  officials,  and  as  hired  teachers  and  technical  experts.  These people  did  not  speak  Japanese  and  had  little  desire  to  learn  it,  which necessitated  foreign  language  study  by  those Japanese  wanting  to  learn  these subjects.  Not  only  were  the  specialists'  lectures  in  English,  but  English  for  a time  became  the  language  of  instruction  in  many Japanese  schools,  and  many texts  were  imported  from  abroad.  These  included  both  elementary  school books,  like  Webster's  spellers,  and  advanced  tomes  such  Darwin's Origin  of Species (Ikeda,  1968).  Natsume  Soseki  (1867-1916),  perhaps Japan's  most revered  twentieth-century  novelist,  who  learned  English  at  Tokyo  University where John  Nakahama  taught,  recalled  that  'when  we went  to school, we  were all  compelled  to  study every subject  in  English;  mathematics,  botany,  geometry, and  so  on'  (Takahashi,  1965).

The  English  which  was  taught  in  schools  was  usually  based  on  some r e n d e r i n g  of  Received  Pronunciation (RP),  and  an  approximation  to  this model  was  used  by  many Japanese  in  business  and  scholarly  studies.  These people  did  not  use  a  pidgin,  or  a  code-mixed  variety  of  loanwords;  they  used a  version  of  English  and  often  studied  it  long  and  enthusiastically.  However, to  the  English  ear,  these  attempts  were  sometimes  lacking  (Sladen,  1913).  For example,  the  following  dialogue  is based  on  text  from  an  official  handbook

published  in  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  century,  entitled The Practical Use of  Conversation  for  Police Authorities:.

(Japanese  police  officer):  What  countryman  are you?

(English  sailor,  apparently  in  some  trouble): I am  a sailor  belong  to  the Golden  Eagle  the  English  man-o'-war.

police:  Why do you strike  this jinrikisha ['rickshaw']  man?

sailor: He  told  me  impolitely.

police:  What does he  told you  impolitely?

sailor: He insulted me saing loudly 'the Sailor the Sailor' when  I am  passing here.

police: Do you striking  this man  for  that?

sailor: Yes.

police: But do  not strike him  for  that  is  forbided.

sailor: I strike  him  no  more.  (Chamberlain,  1904:  145)

Another  view of the  contemporary  language  situation  was that  seen  by  the (somewhat  naive  and  innocent)  eyes  of  Clara  Whitney,  a  14-year-old  girl  who arrived  in Japan  with  her  father  William  Whitney  in  1875. William  Whitney had  been  invited  by Mori Arinori  (1847-1916),  the Japanese  charge' d'affaires in  Washington  DC, to  establish  the  first  business  college  in Japan. 10 In  talking with  government  official  and  former  samurai  Oono  Yaichi,  Clara  notes  in  her diary  that  she  was  surprised  by  his  language  ability:  'Indeed,  I  never  knew before  that  he  was  master  of  so  much  English. We  talked  for  nearly  two  hours without  help  from  anyone,  but  occasional  reference  to  a  dictionary  which  lay between  us'  (Whitney,  1979:  49).  In  another  entry  on  'Fukuzawa's  English', she  has  this  to  say about  the  famous  Meiji  intellectual,  educator  and  newspaper publisher  mentioned  earlier  (I  have  added  curly  bracket  translations  to  her original  transcription):

Mr Fukuzawa  has a comical way of speaking,  using  English  and Japanese  in the utmost confusion,  so that it is difficult  to understand what he really means. For example, in speaking of the Governor:  'Mr Kuriyama is hontoo ni {'really'} kind  man, keredomo {'however')  he  is taisoo {'extremely'} busy kono  setsu {'nowadays'}?' [Mr Kuriyama is a very kind  man,  but  he  is extremely  busy of late].  (Whitney,  1979:221)

At  this  time  it  thus  appears  that  there  were  a  number  of  contact  languages in  use,  both Japanese-based  as well  as  English-based.  Indeed,  there  were  even people  who  were  gradually  becoming  fluent  in  the  standard  versions  of  each l a n guage.  However,  there  were  at  least  two  factors  that  eventually  led  to  the dominance  of standard  English  as the  code  of  choice  whenever Japanese  and

foreigners  met.  The  first  is  sometimes  called  'Preble's  Law'  (Frankel,  1963), after  a commentary  by Lt. George  Preble, one  of Commodore  Perry's  adjutants, in  1854:

They have a great aptitude  at catching  English  sounds and  ask the  American name  of everything  they see, and  so pick  up  a vocabulary  of  our  language. They generally  give us the Japanese,  but  it sounds  so barbarous  to our  ears, we are  not  at much  trouble  to remember  it.  (Preble,  1926:  140)

Thus,  the  default  parameter  came  to  be  that  it was English,  and  not Japanese, that  was  preferred.  Americans  decided  that  it was  impossible  for  anyone  but a Japanese  to  learn Japanese,  and  the Japanese  often concurred.

To  be  sure,  there  were  foreigners,  often  missionaries  and  doctors,  who could s p e a k  J a p a n e s e .  An  American even  wrote  several of t h e first comprehensive Japanese-English  dictionaries  (Hepburn,  1867;  1872;  1886). However, Japanese-speaking  foreigners  were  hardly  the  norm,  as  Basil  Hall Chamberlain,  a  celebrated  Victorian  observer  of Japan,  indicates:

At other  times seeing that you speak Japanese,  they will wag their  heads  and smile  condescendingly,  and  admit  to  one  another  that you  are  really  quite intelligent  - much  as we might  do  in  the  presence  of a  learned  pig  or  an ape  of some  unusual  attainments.  (1904: 383)

In  other  words,  the Japanese  themselves,  too,  thought  that  their  language  was too  hard  for  foreigners  to  acquire.

Figure  3.1  attempts  to  illustrate  some  of  the  dynamics  of  the  languagecontact  situation  in  the  late  nineteenth-century Japan.  At  the  two  extremes on  the  right  and  the  left  are  standard  versions  of  English  and  Japanese respectively.  Connecting  them  are  circles  indicating  the  various  clines  of proficiency  and  register  that  learners  went  through  to  acquire  the t a r g e t l a n guage.  However,  there  are  some  differences  between  the  two  paths.  First, Interpreter's  English,  via  the  influence  of  Dutch,  seems  to  be  a  stage  in  the process  of  acquiring  standard  English.  That  is,  Interpreter's  English  did  not so much  die  out  as become  absorbed  into  the  language-acquisition  continuum. The  Yokohama  Dialect,  however,  probably  never  enabled  people  to  ever actually  aquire  standard  English.  While  Interpreter's  English  was  a  register  or version  of  a  standard  language  (or  at  least  tried  to  be),  the Yokohama  Dialect was a  pidginized  simplification  of  a  standard  language  (and  never  tried  to  be anything  else). And,  as  mentioned  above,  there  were  the  class  and  education differences  as  well.

Pidgins  were  not  the  only  development  that  resulted  from  the  contact  of English  and Japanese.  In  the  later  part  of  the  nineteenth  century,  most  of  the Japanese  people  had  little  contact  with  the  new  foreigners,  either  sailors  or dignitaries.  Pidgin Japanese  seems  to  have  been  used  only  by  those  living  in t he  port  cities  of  Yokohama,  Nagasaki  and  Kobe,  and  then  probably  only  by

limited segments of the population. However, this does not mean  that  English made no intrusions  into  the Japanese  language, or into the daily lives of the rest of the Japanese  people. Borrowing, or the nativization and use of English loanwords in a wide variety of registers, has been  an important  and critical aspect of  Japanese  communicative  strategies from  the late nineteenth  century onwards.

## Language  reform  in early modern  Japan

As we have  noted,  to achieve  the goals  of instant  modernization,  Japan imported  many tools and technologies  of every kind  from  the West. One of these  was English.  Some  influential  leaders  even  advocated  the elimination of  the Japanese  language. In the 1870s Mori Arinori, Japan's  first  minister of education  and the architect of the modern Japanese school system  (the  same

charge  d'affaires  who  had  invited  the  Whitneys  to Japan)  preached kokugo haishi  eigo saiyooron ('Abolish Japanese,  Adopt  English',  SSKltSIESffltiO. He l a mented  that:

Under  the  circumstances,  our  meager  language, which  can  never  be  of  use outside  of  our  small  islands,  is doomed  to yield  to  the  domination  of  the English  tongue, especially when  the power of steam and  electricity shall  have pervaded  our  land  . . . All reason  suggests  its disuse.  (Mori,  1873: lvii)

Mori  even  wrote  to Yale  University  professor  W.  Dwight  Whitney,  one  of  the most  famous  American  linguists  of  his  day  (no  relation  to  the  Whitney  family mentioned  earlier),  asking  his  opinion  of Japan's  adopting  English:

The  spoken  language  of Japan  being  inadequate  to  the  growing  necessities of the people  . . . and  too poor  to be made, by a phonetic alphabet,  sufficiently useful  as  a  written  language,  the  idea  prevails  among  many  of  our  best educated  men  and  profound  thinkers,  that  if we would  keep  pace  with  the age  we  must  adopt  some  copious,  expandable  and  expanding  European language  [presumably  and  preferably  English], print  our  laws and  transact all public  business in it, as soon  as possible, and  have it taught  in  our  schools as the future  language  of the country to the gradual exclusion  of our  present language, spoken  and  written. 11

Although  the  official  adoption  of English  was never  implemented,  the  fact  that this idea was even  suggested  by men  of such  influence  was significant.  However, not  only  in Japan,  but  also  from  abroad,  more  restrained  voices  appeared.  For example,  Professor  Joseph  Henry  (the  first  Secretary  of  the Smithsonian Institution  and  a  noted  linguist  in  his  own  right),  when  asked  his  opinion  on this  issue  in  1873,  replied:

Let  the  English  language  be  studied  as much  as possible; let it take  in Japan the  place so long occupied  by Chinese; let it become  the learned  tongue,  the classical  language  . . . but  let  the  beneficial  effect  of  all  this  be  felt  in  the Japanese  tongue  itself  (cited  in  Mori,  1873: 82-3).

Though  such  extreme  measures  as abolishing Japanese  were  never  actually adopted  in Japan,  the  point  was  noted  that  English  was  the  language  of  law and  commerce,  science  and  medicine,  technology  and  war.  English  was  the language  of modernity,  and  the  language  of the future.  That  said,  the  problem of  language  reform  in  a rapidly modernizing  society still remained.  While  those arguing  for  the  adoption  of  English  ultimately  failed,  such  advocates  were nonetheless  often  more  successful  in  promoting  the  use  of  the  letters  of  the English  alphabet,  rather  than  the  English  language  itself in Japan.  In  the  1880s and  1890s, language  reform  in Japan  eventually came  down  to four  possibilities: (1)  replacing Japanese  with  English;  (2)  replacing  characters  with  the kana syllabary;  (3)  adopting  a  roman  alphabet;  and (4)  limiting  the  n u m b e r of

characters.  When  the  replacement  option  did  not  work,  many  language reformers  directed  their  attention  to  changing  the Japanese  orthography. Modern Japanese  has  several  writing  systems  apart  from  the  famous  SinoJapanese  characters.  There  are  two  phonetic  syllabaries  based  on  cursive abbreviations  of  Chinese  characters.  The hiragana symbols  are  used  for particles, verbal  endings, adverbs, and  other  grammatical  functions. Katakana symbols are used  as a kind  of  Japanese  italic script. Words referring  to  things considered  unique  and  special,  foreign places  or  names,  loanwords, onomatopoeia,  are usually written  in katakana.

Various advocates suggested  replacing  the  Sino-Japanese  characters  with hiragana and katakana from  the  mid-nineteenth  century  onwards.  In  1883, various like-minded  individuals banded  loosely together  to form  the Kana no Kai (the Kana Club).  In  many ways, using kana would  have  been  a  natural and  logical  choice  for Japanese  language  reformers  and  one  certainly  less radical than  replacing the language with English. However, it appears that this idea  appeared  prematurely.  Until  the Genbun Itchi  Undoo movement,  the movement to unify the spoken and the written language, achieved some degree of success, any kind of script reform was next to impossible: those who  favoured the  use  of kana had  not  yet  tackled  the  major  problem  of style  reform.  That is,  they failed  to realize  that  classical literary Japanese was just  as hard  to  read in kana as it was in  characters.  In  some  senses, it was actually  more  difficult, as the  characters  at least partly indicate word  meanings and word  boundaries visually.  'Rather  than  simplifying  matters,  therefore,  their  manner  of writing actually  compounded  the  difficulty  of reading Japanese'  (Twine,  1991: 233). This,  plus internal  theoretical  squabbles, doomed  the  movement.

Proposals  to adopt  the  roman  European  alphabet were made  as early as the  1870s. Fukuzawa Yukichi and Mori Arinori, aside from  pressing for  English, were also among  the first  to see the  advantages  of using romanized Japanese. (Roomanji-kwai had  some  10,000 members  (Twine,  1991). By the  time of  the

For one thing, such advocates claimed, it would naturally take care of a number of  stylistic  problems,  as any  dialect  or  register  could  theoretically  be  written in rooma-ji ('roman  letters').  By the  1880s  the  Rooma-ji  Club or Roomanji-kai) Japanese victory in  the  Sino-Japanese War of  1895, things Chinese were at  an all-time  low,  including  Chinese  characters  and  the  Chinese  readings  of characters. Author  Ishikawa  Takuboku  even  kept  a diary written  in Japanese in rooma-ji published  in  1909  (Ishikawa,  1909  [1985]).

However, there were still many problems to overcome. One, as mentioned, was the issue of adopting the colloquial vernacular, as opposed to classical SinoJapanese, as the written  style. Until  this could  be accomplished,  little in  terms of  script  reform  could  be  done.  A second  difficulty  was  the  popularity  of Chinese  and  Chinese-like  collocations  in Japanese  among  many  of  the

educated  elite. Many intellectuals continued  to study the classic Chinese  texts, and  had  a vested  interest  in  keeping  the  status  quo.  Finally,  there  was  the problem  of romanization  itself, and  how phonemic  it should  be. There  were at least three  systems in use: Hyoojun-shiki (the  'Standard  System'), Kunrei-shiki (the  'Government-Issued  System'), Nippon-shiki (the  Japanese  System'),  each of which  differed  from  the  other  in various ways. Some  examples  are  shown in  Table  3.3. 12

Each  system  reflects  different  linguistic  philosophies.  The Hyoojin-shiki ('Standard  System')  is also known  as the Hebon-shiki ('Hepburn  System')  after the American  physician and missionary who used it in the first  comprehensive Japanese-English  dictionary  (1886), and  is close  to  the  way Japanese  words would be spelled in everyday English. The Nippon-shiki (Japanese  System')  and the Kunrei-shiki ('Government-Issued  System')  are both  phonemic,  although less transparent  to non-Japanese.  To this day, there  is no  clear  consensus  on which system is the best. In Japanese school texts the Kunrei-shiki system is used, while  the  Foreign  Ministry and  the  railways use the Hyooyinshiki system, as  do most  libraries  and  many  publishers. 13 Both  systems  are  quite  common  in everyday Japanese,  but  neither  has been  adopted  by the  government  as  the sole  official  system.

## Taisho  terms  and  wartime  words

Oddly  enough,  one  could  argue  that  it was probably  the  Taisho  Period  (191226),  the  time just  before  and  after  the  First  World  War,  which  was  the  heyday of Japanese-English  language  contact  and  borrowing.  This  was  a  time  when literary  stylistics  and  script  reforms  were  set  aside  in  a  growing  love  affair  with English.  Maeda  (1995)  says  that  of  some  1,500  common  loanwords  in  use during  the  last  year  of  the  Meiji  Era  (1912),  about  75  percent  were from English.  However,  it was  the  number  of  loanwords  entering Japanese  during this  period  that  is significant:  in  fact,  statistics  show  (compare  Table  2.2  above and  Table  3.4  below)  much  more  English  borrowing  has  taken  place  after  the Second  World  War,  but  the  Taisho  period  established  patterns  of  taking, modifying,  and  creating  English  vocabulary  items  and English-language concepts  and  cognitive  schemas  which  continue  to  this  day.  While  many  of t h e  previous  Meiji  Era  loanwords  referred  to  abstract  notions  dealing  with Westernization  or  modernization,  many  of  the  Taisho  loanwords  (which  often came  directly  from  the  United  States)  were  related  to  everyday  practical  life or  popular  culture  (Sonoda,  1975).

Table 3.4 The percentages of loanwords by language acquired  in Japanese  during the Taisho Period

| lor language   | percentage   |
|----------------|--------------|
| English        | 63.0%        |
| Dutch          | 14.2%        |
| Portuguese     | 13.0%        |
| French         | 3.7%         |
| Spanish        | 2.5%         |
| German         | 1.8%         |
| other          | 1.8%         |

(modified  from  Sonoda  1975: 26-7;  Ueno  1968:  361)

Throughout  the  1920s English  loanwords  continued  to be  borrowed  quite readily,  and  some  of  the  most  commonly  used  current  English  loans  were i n t r o d u c e d  at  that  time.  These  include takushii ('taxi'), rajio ( ' r a d i o ' ) ,  and sarariiman ('salaried-man',  or  male  white-collar  office  worker).  The  influx  of British  and  American  technical  advisors,  teachers,  and  missionaries  during  the previous  Meiji  Era  had  given  the  English  language  a  high  level  of  prestige  and savoir  faire, and  studying  it  had  immediate  practical  applications.  It  became fashionable  among Japanese  students  and haikara people  (the  'high  collar' sophisticates  mentioned  earlier)  to  intersperse  their  daily  conversation  with

English  borrowings. 14 One  cannot  forget  one  of  those  most  original of Japanese-coinages:  the mo-ga ( ' m o d e r n  girl',  or  'flapper').  In  fact,  according to  Arakawa  (1977),  various -girl words  were  some  of  the  most  productive  of the  times. These  included  terms  like kyampu  gaaru ('camp  girl'), depaato  gaaru ( ' d e p a r t m e n t  store  girl'), sutekki  gaaru ('stick  girl'), doa  gaaru (' d o o r girl'), gasorin  gaaru ('gasoline  girl')  and ea garru ('air  girl') (Sonoda,  1975).  Few  of t h e s e  t e r m s  survive  today  save  for ofisu  gaaru ('office girl'),  which lingers t h r o u g h  t he  acronym OL ( p r o n o u n c e d oo-eru) for  'office  lady',  the  term for female  office  workers.

There  was  another  reason  why  the  Taisho  was  such  a  critical  period  in Japanese-English  language  contact.  During  this  time,  linguistics  as  a  science came  into  its  own  in Japan,  and  increased  attention  was  devoted  to  English and  English-language  education.  Large  numbers  of  Western  novels and scholarly works were  translated  into Japanese.  Ichikawa  Sanki was probably  the most  important  linguist  of  the  pre-war  period,  and  he  was  also  one  of  the  first scholars  to  rigorously  investigate  the  presence  of  English  in Japanese.  His prediction  was  that:

The influence  of foreign  languages - especially English - on Japanese  is of such  importance  that probably  not only words and  expressions will  continue to  be  borrowed  in  greater  numbers  but  even  the  structure  and  grammar  of the Japanese  language will be  considerably  modified.  (Ichikawa,  1931: 141)

The  fervent  nationalism  of  the  military  regimes  of  the  1930s  and 1940s tried,  rather  unsuccessfully,  to  eliminate  English  borrowings  in Japanese,  but all  things  Western  were  held  in  suspicion,  even  languages.  Movements,  both public  and  private,  tried  to  eradicate  all  foreign  linguistic  poison  from t h e Yamato-kotoba -  the  original  language  of  Japan,  the  language  of the  gods.  Thus, for  example,  the  commonly  understood  word anaunsaa ( ' a n n o u n c e r ' ) was replaced  by  the  esoteric hoosoo-in (literally  meaning  'broadcast  person'),  and t h e  word rekoodo ( ' [ g r a m m a p h o n e ] record')  was  supplanted  by  the  strange onban (literally  meaning  'euphonic  board').  Only  a  few  terms,  most  related to war effort,  entered  the  language: for  example,  the B-29 (American  bomber), and reedaa ( ' r a d a r ' ) (Sonoda,  1975). The  end  of  the  Second  World  War quickly  saw  English  regain  its  former  level  of  popularity  and  prestige.  The English  terms for  the  items  mentioned  above, for  example,  reappeared  at  once a n d t h e  postwar  American occupation s p u r r e d even  more l i n g u i s t i c borrowings.  However,  the  teaching  of  English  during  the  war  was  sharply curtailed,  leaving  a  whole  generation  with  little  or  no  English  competence. Japanese  people  during  the  American  occupation (1945-52)  were  thus  left with  two  choices:  either  to  quickly  acquire  standard  English  competence,  or to  speak  to  their  American  occupiers  in  a  pidginized  form  of  English.

That  many  people  tried  the  former  is evidenced  by  the  numerous  books and  English-language  materials  that  appeared  immediately  after hostilities

ended.  For  example,  a small  pamphlet  on  conversational  English  sold  three and  a half  million  copies  almost  as soon  as it was printed,  and  English  again became  institutionalized  in  the  educational  curriculum.  The  occupation, moreover,  provided  a  rich  context  for  less  formal  linguistic  contact.  For example,  the  US military bases needed  local workers  to maintain  them,  and American  servicemen  spent  off-duty  time  touring  and  sightseeing.  American government  officials  and  private  citizens  became  increasingly  involved  with Japanese  civil  and  cultural  affairs,  all  of  which  meant  increasing  contact between Japanese  and  foreigners.  Many,  on  both  sides, were  linguistically unprepared  for  this  meeting.

After Japan's  defeat  in  the  Second  World  War,  there  then  developed  an English-based  pidgin  that  was  used  between  local Japanese  and  the  US occupation  forces stationed  throughout  the country. As the US occupiers were culturally,  economically  and  militarily  dominant,  it  is  not  surprising  that American  linguistic  chauvinism  pervaded  this  pidgin  variety.  Miller  (1967) argues  that  it is necessary  to  distinguish  at  least  two varieties  of  this  speech. The  first  variety  was  used  primarily  for  communication  with  shopkeepers, servants,  labourers,  and  employees  at  US military  installations.  The  second considerably  more  specialized  variety served  'for  what verbal  communication [that  was]  necessary  between  non-Japanese-speaking  foreigners  and  the extensive  world  of  their  local  lady friends  of  every variety  and  description' (1967: 263). Miller cites the Japanese  designation  for  this latter  type of speech as pangurisshu, or  'street-walker  English'. 15

The Korean War drastically increased the number of American  servicemen stationed  in,  and  passing  through, Japan.  It  also  spread  a  form  of  pidgin English  to  the  Korean  peninsula,  and  perhaps  other  places  in  the  East  and Southeast Asia as well. These  pidgin varieties are often  generically referred  to as  'Bamboo  English'  in  the  literature  (e.g. Algeo,  1960; Norman,  1954, 1955; Reinecke  et al.,  1975; Webster,  1960). The  Korean  version  of  this pidgin  was almost  identical  with  that  spoken  in Japan,  with  only  a  few  local  Korean additions. Many American  soldiers had  prior service in Japan; many words of Japanese  origin  were  supposedly  well  understood  by Koreans  (Algeo,  1960; Miller,  1967). As was the case with  the Yokohama Dialect, there are few  extant published  examples of postwar Bamboo English. As Miller points out,  'neither variety  of  the  pidgin  is likely  to  leave  the  kind  of literary  records  that  would ever  make  possible  precise  documentation' (1967:  264).  Instead,  we  are obliged  to  rely  on  second-hand  accounts  and  memoirs  of  people  who  were amateur  linguists  at  best. James  Michener,  for  example,  constructed  the following  dialogue  between  an  American  airman,  Lloyd,  and  his Japanese mistress, Hana-ogi,  in  his novel Sayonara (1954). The  interlinear  glosses  and translations  are  my own:

1. Hana-ogi: Lloyd-san you takushi please. "taxi"

"Lloyd, would you  please get a taxi?'

2. Lloyd: Daijobu, I  takushi, get, ne? "OK' "taxi" "alright?"
2. "Fine, I'll  call  a  cab, OK?"
3. H-o: /

"I'd  like  to  stay with  you  but  I've  really got  to  catch  the  train."

"Stay a little while  longer  please."

- Deki-nai. Lloyd-san. No can stay.
5. H-o: "can't"

"I can't  do  that,  Lloyd,  I can't  stay."

6. L: Doo shite?  Whatsahurry? "why?"

"Why not? What's  the  hurry?"

7. H-o: Anoo-ne! Takarazuka. My jobu,  ne? Ijobugo,
2. ne? "hey  . . . ' "right?" "right?"

"Takarazuka  theatre  troop  is my job,  right?  I have  to  go  to work,  don't you  think?"

"Wait just  a goddamn  minute!"

"1 o'clock'

"now'

"right?"

"Takarazuka  is starting  today at one. It's still  only  10 o'clock,  right?"

9. H-o: Anoo-ne! Lloyd-san. You mess my hair,  ne.

"Listen!"

"Hey, you'll  mess up  my  hair!"

/ beauty sawn go, make nice, deshoo ?

"probably; right?"

"Don't you  think  I should  go get a nice  hair  style at  the  beauty  shop?"

10. L: No,  no, no, anoo-ne! You takusan suteki now.

"Listen!"

"many; a lot"  "pretty"

"No No No! Listen, you're very pretty already!"  (Michener,  1954:  170-1)

Other  sources  for  the  pidgin  English  of  this  era  include  Algeo (1960), Goodman  (1967), Norman  (1955), and Webster  (1960). Hume  and  Annarino (1953a;  1953b)  and  Hume (1954)  also  provide  a  n u m b e r  of  examples of Bamboo  English,  although  many  of  these  are  somewhat  racist  and  sexist,  to say  the  least.  O t h e r  accounts  are  found  in  cartoons  from  Japanese  and  US military  newspapers,  two  examples  of  which  are  given  in  Figure  3.2,  which reproduces  two  of  the  many  'Baby-san'  cartoons  of  the  early  1950s.

Before  we  leave  the  Second  World  War  era,  mention  should  be  made  of one  of  the  last  serious  suggestions  to  abolish Japanese,  this  time  from Shiga Naoya  (1883-1972),  one  of Japan's  most  admired  novelists.  In  the  April  1946 issue of  Kaizoo (Reconstruction),  a  widely-circulated  intellectual journal,  he stated  that:

More than once during the war, I had occasion to reflect upon  the  suggestion made sixty years ago by Mori Arinori about adopting English  as our  national language. I thought  about  how things might have been  if his suggestion  had been  carried  out.  One  may imagine  that Japanese  culture would  surely  have advanced  far  beyond  the point where it is today. It occurred  to me  that  most likely  a war  of  the  sort  we  have just  been  through  would  never  have  taken place.  And  it  also  occurred  to  me  that  then  our  scholarship  would  have advanced  more  easily, and  even  that we would  have been  able  to  recall  our school days as having been something pleasant. We would be like our  children who  simply  have  never  heard  of  the  cumbersome  old Japanese  system  of arbitrary weights and  measures - we would all be speaking English with  no consciousness  that  it was a foreign  language  - And  so I got  the  idea,  how would  it be  if  Japan  on  this  occasion  [the  defeat  of  1945]  acted  with  direct and swift resolution, and  simply adopted  the best language, the most  beautiful language  in  the  world,  for  its  national  language!  -  I  am  not  at  all  wellinformed  about the purely technical aspects of the question  of switching  from

one  language  to another,  but  I do  not believe it to be all that  difficult.  Once the  necessary teachers have been  trained, I believe that the new language  can simply be  introduced  from  the  first year of elementary  education  on.  (cited in  Miller,  1977: 44-5)

As with  Mori's  proposal  in  the  late  nineteenth  century,  such  drastic  steps were  not  implemented,  even  with  the  tremendous  social  and economic upheavals  caused  by  the Japan's  defeat.  However,  as  Roy Andrew  Miller  says, this  does  not  mean  that  such  criticisms  were  soon  forgotten,  or ' without continuing  influence  in  the  consideration  of  sociolinguistic  questions  in  the literature  in Japan'  (1977: 46).  Indeed,  we will  see  these  issues  come  up  again in  our  later  discussions  of  race,  language,  and  national  identity  in  Chapter 11.

## Contemporary Japanese-English  contact:  Linguistic  features

Since  the  Second  World  War  and  the  American  occupation,  the  quantity  of English  in  Japanese,  in  the  form  of  borrowing,  grammatical  transfer, or Japanese  English  neologisms  has increased  substantially.  Today,  it is  impossible to  interact  in Japanese,  or  with Japanese,  without  recourse  to  English  of  one variety or  another.  In  this section  of the  chapter,  I attempt  to  provide  a  concise summary  of  the  formal  aspects  of  contemporary  linguistic  contact  through  a discussion  of  a  number  of salient  linguistic  features,  at  the  levels  of  phonology, morphology,  and  syntax,  relating  to  the  'nativization'  of  English  loans  in Japanese.

## Phonological nativization

The  basic  structure  of Japanese  syllables  in  consonant  plus  vowel  (CV),  and this  structure  is  applied  to  loanwords.  A  consonant  cluster  and syllable-final consonant  is  usually  modified  into  a  CV sequence  by  the  addition  of  vowels (dubbed  'epenthetic'  vowels by linguists)  following  most Japanese  consonants. Thus  'McDonald's'  in Japanese  becomes ma-ku-do-na-ru-do, and ' Christmas' becomes ku-ri-su-ma-su. The  main  exception  to  this  general  pattern  is  the occurrence  of syllable-final  and  word-final  / n / ,  thus,  'companion'  is  rendered as konpanion 3 &gt; / t ~ ^ - &gt; ,  ' m e l o n '  becomes meron &gt; P &gt; ,  ' r u n '  as ran, in hoomu ran /fr-A^&gt; ' h o m e r u n ' ,  and  'woman'  as uuman £ -"7&gt;  .  This syllabic alteration  of words  taken  from  English  (or  created  in  English)  also  contributes to  a  n u m b e r  of  the  features  highlighted  below  in  Table  3.5, which  is  intended to  summarize  a number  of the  most important  phonological  modifications  that occur  in  nativization  of  English  in  the  language:

Table  3.5  is intended  to  represent  a number  of the  most  salient  features of phonological  contact and modification.  Perhaps the most distinctive of such processes  is the  strong  tendency  to add  a syllable-final  or word-final  vowel  to consonants. In most cases this involves the addition  of/u/;  and  in other  cases / o /  after  final  stops / t /  and  / d / ;  and  / i /  following  / c /  and  / j / .  In  the  above table,  there  is  also  a  list  of  a  number  of  regularly-occurring  consonant substitutions.  But there  are  a number  of variations  to  the  general  patterning indicated  above. For example, the word  'cake', which entered Japanese  in  the mid-nineteenth  century was previously pronounced keeku &gt;r-5 (as  predicted by Table  3.5 above), is now more  commonly  pronounced keeki &lt;r-*.

## The  morphology of  English loanwords

At  the  morphological  level,  a  number  of  distinct  processes  may  be identified, i ncluding  truncation,  acronym  formation,  affixing  and  compounding.  In  the case  of truncation, many  English  loanwords  are  abbreviated  or ' t r u n c a t e d ' when  borrowed  into Japanese.  Examples  of  this  process  of  truncation  include t h e  following: homo /fr' E  from  'homosexual', kiro + P from  'kilometer', roke U*T from (film) ' l o c a t i o n ' , puro  ~fu from  'professional', poruno ^)VJ from ' p o r n o g r a p h y ' , reji l / y  from  (cash)  'register',  and uran  05&gt; from ' u r a n i u m ' . Other  high-frequency  truncated  items  include suupaa ' s u p e r m a r k e t ' , depaato, ' d e p a r t m e n t  store', demo ' d e monstration', maiku ' microphone', terebi 'television', kiro ' k i l o g r a m ' , apaato ' a p a r t m e n t  (building)',  and ea  kon ' a i r conditioner'. Sonoda ( 1 9 7 5 ) argues t h a t  when  an  English l o a n w o r d is borrowed, grammatical  inflections  are  often  discarded  as  in sukii ' s k i i n g ' , sarariiman ' s alaried  man',  and koonbiifu ' c o r n e d  b e e f .  It  is  also  worth  noting  that  plural inflections  are  also  invariably  dropped,  as in surii  sutoraiku ('three  strikes') or foa-booru ('four balls').

English-derived acronyms a n d abbreviations form  a  distinctive  subset  in t h e  contemporary Japanese  lexicon,  and  include  such  diverse  items  as: CM (shii emu) ' c o m m e r c i a l  message'; DPE  (dii pii ii) ' d e v e l o p i n g , printing; enlarging'; J-League (jee  riigu) ' J a p a n [Soccer]  League'; J-pop (fee poppu) J a p a n e s e  popular  music'; J-rap (jee  rappu) ' J a p a n e s e rap music'; JAL (jaru) J a p a n  Airlines'; JALT (jaruto) J a p a n  Association  of  Language  Teachers'; LL (eru  eru) ' l a n g u a g e  laboratory'; OB  (oo bit) ' old  boy'; OL  (oo eru) 'office lady'; UFO (yuufoo) ' unidentified  flying  object', WC (daburu  shii) ' water  closet;  toilet'. What  is  striking  about  many  of  these  acronyms  is  that  while  a  subset are obviously  'imported'  items (UFO,  WC, etc.)  many  others  refer  to  phenomena t h a t  are  particularly  or  uniquely Japanese,  and  are  special ' made-in-Japan' creations,  even  though  there  may  be  other  equally  applicable  loans  available for  use  (for  example, DPE for  photo  processing).  The  nativized  Japanese pronunciation  may also markedly  change  how such  acronyms  are  pronounced (e.g., yuufoo for  UFO). A number  of these  also modify  nouns, so  that CM  songu ( p r o n o u n c e d shii  em songu) is a  commercial  television  or  radio jingle.  The  use of  the  abbreviation  J '  to  indicate  something Japanese  has  become  extremely common,  and  there  are  many  related  terms  in  use  at  present,  among  which JLeague, J-pop,  and  J-rap are  arguably  three  of  the  most  common  expression.  In contrast,  the  abbreviation H  (etchi) l hentai [Japanese]  now  refers  generally  to erotic  material  and  even  to  lecherous  men  (especially  when  used  by  women) (Motwani,  1991).

Compounds a n d blends a n d  are  also  important  in  this  context,  and  it  has been  argued  that  processes  of  compounding  are  involved  in  around  two-thirds of  all  English  loanwords  entering Japanese.  Sonoda  (1975)  estimates  that  twot hirds  of  all  English  loanwords  enter Japanese  in  this  way. Representative

examples  of  such  compounds  include masu  komi 'mass  communications', bodi kon ' b o d y  consciousness', waa  puro ' word  processing', oorudo  misu ' old  miss', ero-guro-nansensu ' e r o t i c  grotesque  nonsense', enjin-stoppu ' e n g i n e  s t o p ' ,  and gasorin  sutando ' gasoline  stand'.  By way  of  explanation,  'body  consciousness' was  a  trend  in  the  early  1990s,  involving  the  promotion  of  'buff healthy  and sexy  bodies,  while,  predictably,  an  'old  miss'  is  synonymous  with spinster. ' Erotic  grotesque  nonsense'  refers  to  gratuitous  explicit  sex  and  violence  in popular  culture,  especially  films  and  comic  books.  'Engine  stop' (enjin-sutoppu), or  the  abbreviated  form ensuto, means  a  breakdown,  usually  an  automobile breakdown.  'Gasoline  stand'  corresponds  to  the  American  'gas  station',  and masu  komi refers  to  the  mass  media/especially  the  press  or  television  news. Hybrid  compounds  can  also  be  formed  by  blending Japanese  and  English t e r ms,  as  in nuudo shashin ('nude picture'), denki  sutando (' standing electric l i g h t ' ) ,  and uchuu roketto ('space rocket').

Affixation  also  merits  attention.  The  use  of  prefixes  and  suffixes  provides another  means  of  incorporating  loanwords  into Japanese.  Native  Japanese t e r ms  can  become  affixed  to  loanwords,  and  loanword  prefixes  and suffixes can  also  be  used  for  both  native  Japanese  and  borrowed  terms.  English l o a n w o r d s t a k i n g native  J a p a n e s e affixes i n c l u d e amerika-jin T^ [ )tiX ' American  person', saabisu-uryoo It\i7&gt;Pl 'service  charge', sutorippu  gekijoo X h U y^fJif ' s t r i p  show', amerika-shiki T* U^Jit  'American  style', amerika-sei Y^ { JtjM ' made  in  America', sairui-gasu MMfi'X ' t e a r  gas',  a n d pan-ya / N &gt; M ' b r e a d  store',  i.e. ' b akery'.

English  loanwords  can  also  be  used  as  affixes  for  other  terms  already borrowed  into Japanese.  For  example,  the  English  'one'  is quite  productive, and  the  Horiuchi  dictionary  (1999)  has  over  one  hundred  entries  with  the wan prefix,  including: wan-kusshon ' o n e  cushion' ( a p p r o a c h i n g s o m e o n e t h r o u g h  an  intermediary), wan-man ' o n e  m a n '  (a  bossy  person), wan-man kaa ' o n e - m a n  car'  (a  bus  without  a  conductor), wan-piisu ' o n e  piece'  (a  pullover, a  one-piece  dress), wan-uei ' o n e  way'  (street), wan-pataan ' o n e  p a t t e r n ' (onetrack  mind,  repetitive), wan-ruumu manshon ' o n e - r o o m  mansion'  (a  studio apartment), wan-saido  geemu 'one-side  game'  (a  one-sided  game) (Horiuchi, 1999:  721-3).  Other  common  English-based  affixes  include  the  suffixes -in ('in'), won ('loan'),  and kompurekkusu ('complex');  and  the  prefixes hai( h i g h ) , noo-, a n d hoomu. Examples  of  the  suffixes  include hoomu-in ( ' h o m e i n ' , i.e. r e a c h i n g h o m e base  in  baseball), kaa-roon ( ' c a r - l o a n ' ) ,  and inferioriti kompurekkusu ('inferiority  complex').  Examples  of  the  prefixes  are hai-sensu ('high-sense',  having  good  sense  or  taste); noo-taimu ('no-time',  the  end  of  a sports  game);  and hoomu-ueaa ('home-wear',  casual  clothes  worn  around  the house).

## Loanwords  and  syntax

Loanwords  that  have been  incorporated  into  the Japanese  language  system generally follow  the  morphological  and  syntactic  rules of Japanese  grammar. For  example,  in  Table  3.6  below,  the  first  five  sentences  contain 'native Japanese'  nouns while the second five have English loanwords. Each  sentence may be glossed  as 'Please open  (this)  -',  and  each  subject-noun  combination (whether  loanword  or Japanese)  takes  the  same  objective  case  marker  and behaves in very similar  fashion:

Table  3.6 Example  sentences  containingjapanese terms and  English  loanwords  in  parallel  sentences

Although the vast majority English loanwords in Japanese are nouns,  there are also sizeable numbers of adjectives  and adverbs. Here, one might note  that Japanese adjectives  may be broadly classified  into two types keiyooshi or  'z-type' adjectives, which  decline for  tense or negation, and  'naKype' adjectives  taking the  particle -na. Examples  of  'retype'  adjectives  include shizuka ('quiet'),  as in shizuka-na machi ('a  quiet  town'); and kirei ('pretty')  as in kirei-na hana ('a pretty flower'). Generally speaking, English loanwords usually take this particle. Kamiya's  concise  (1994)  dictionary  gives scores  of  examples,  including  the following:

hansamu  na wakai dansei ('a  handsome  young  man'), naisu  [na] heyaasutairu (a  nice  hairstyle'), doramachikku  na  tenkai ('a  dramatic  development'), chaamingu na onna no ko ('a  charming young woman'), furesshu  na kudamono ('fresh  fruit'), romanchikku na kimochi ('romantic  feeling'), derikeeto na mondai ('a  delicate  problem'), karafuru najinsei ('a  colourful  life'), dandii  nafukusoo ('dandy/gaudy  clothes'), supesharu na hito ('a  special  person'), gurotesuku na kaibutsu ('a  grotesque  monster'), dorai na  onna ('unsentimental  woman'), haikara na hito ('a  high  collar  person').

There  are  exceptions  to  this, however.  For  instance,  the  word nau ('now') will  take  the  z-type  adjective  markers,  as  in nau-i  onna ('a  real  now  girl').  The -na particle  is also  sometimes  dropped,  creating  adjective-noun  combinations. This  is  especially  common  for  loanword-adjective/loanword-noun pairs,  as  in this  example  from  Kamiya:

Watashi wa tanjoobi ni supesharu dinaa  o gochisoo shite moraimashita ga, sore wa otto no isshuukan  bun no kyuuryoo ni sootoo shimasu

T had  a special dinner for  my birthday,  but  it cost  my husband  a week's  pay.' (Kamiya,  1994: 329)

English  loanword  adverbs  behave  much  like  native Japanese  terms, and  usually modify  verbs  by  taking  the  particle -ni, as  in naisu-ni ('nicely') or dorai-ni ('dryly', ' u n s e n t i m e n t a l l y ' ) .

At  the  level  of  syntax,  it is important  to  note  that  in Japanese  a great  many nouns  may  be  verbalized  through  the  addition  of  the  auxiliary  verb suru ('to do'):  as in unten  suru ('to  drive'), shigoto suru ('to  work'),  etc. English  loanword nouns  are  often  similarly verbalized  through  the  addition  of suru, e.g. gorufu suru ('to  g o l f ) , sakkaa suru ('to  play  soccer'), tenisu  suru ('to  play  tennis'), booringu  suru ('to  bowl'), appu  suru ('to  go  up,  to  improve'), dansu  suru ('to dance'),  and doraibu  suru ('to  drive').  Another  important  feature  at  the  level of  syntax  relates  to  the  pronominal  system  and  what  might  be  regarded  as  the ' Englishization'  of Japanese  syntax,  in  two  senses.  First,  although personal pronouns  such  as kare ( ' h e ' )  or kanojo ('she')  do  exist  in Japanese,  traditionally, these  were  far  less frequently  used  than  in  Western  languages.  However,  many linguists  have  noted  a  substantial  increase  in  their  use  over  the  last  century or  so,  an  innovation  thought  by  some  to  be  traceable  to  the  influence of English.  Second,  as was  noted  in  Chapter  2,  certain  loanword  pronouns  have also  made  a  noticeable  impact,  especially  the  term mai ('my'),  which  occurs in  such  compounds  as mai  hoomu ('my  house'), maipuraibashii ('my  privacy'), mai  seihin ('my  product'),  and mai  sekando  kaa ('my  second  car').

Finally,  at  the  level  of  semantics  (or  'meaning'),  it  is significant  that  for  a number  of  concepts  brought  into Japan  from  the  West,  the  older  Japanese

caiques  or  'loan  translations'  have  been  replaced  by  English  loanwords.  For example, entaku ('taxi')  became takushii;  kooshaki ('elevator')  became erebeetaa, and higyoo ('strike')  became sutoraiki (Sonoda,  1975).  The  analysis  of  such semantic  negotiations  and  formulations  will  be  explored  in  detail  in  later chapters,  but  here  it  is worth  noting  that  such  issues  have  long  been  an  issue of  concern  within  Japan.

Other  issues  relating  to  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  Japanese language  have also  figured  in various intellectual  debates. In  1950, for  example, one  of  the  most  influential  Japanese  philologists  and  folklorists  of  his  day, Yanagita  Kunio,  delivered  the  following,  largely  negative,  assessment  of  his native  tongue:

The  vocabulary  of  modern Japanese  is limited;  the  number  of  words  are plentiful  but  the  types are  limited;  because  of the  method  of construction  of the Japanese  language's  lexicon,  phrases,  and  grammar,  there  is a  tendency for  them  to be  the  same; if a Japanese  tries  to write  a little  longer  sentence they  can  get  bored;  there  is no  one  who  does  not  have  this  kind  of  feeling. (Yanagita,  1950  [1963]: 453, my  translation) 16

The  counter-argument  to  this  view,  based  on  a  consideration  of  the  unique history  of  the  language,  is that,  in  fact, Japanese  has  numerous  resources  and t e c h n i q u e s  available  for  the  coinage  of  new  words,  as  well  as  translation  of semantic  concepts  from  other  cultures  and  languages,  due  not  least  to  its  long history  of  linguistic  association  with  China,  as well  as  its  more  recent  contact with  European  languages  such  as  English  (cf.  Suzuki,  1976).

Due  to  the  language  contact  with  China,  especially  through  the  written language,  in  contemporary Japanese  today  there  are  words  derived  from  both the  native Japanese  language  and  Chinese.  Some  words  are  directly  borrowed from  Chinese  (or  carry  Sinitic  pronunciations  of  Sino-Japanese  characters  for native  terms),  and  such  lexemes  are  referred to kan-go, or ' Chinese-origin words'. In  contrast,  'indigenous'  words are  called wa-go, Japanese-based  words'. In  addition,  there  are  now  many gairai-go, or  'foreign  words',  in Japanese,  the majority,  naturally,  based  on  English.  As  a  result,  in  communication,  many concepts  and  notions  may  be  expressed  by  choosing  between  three  sets  of vocabulary:  native Japanese wa-go t e r m s ,  Chinese-based kan-go, or gairai-go loanwords.  This  is illustrated  in  Table  3.7,  which  shows  some  possible  terms for  various  ideas  given  in  the  left  column  and  their  various  counterparts' l oanword,  native Japanese,  or  Chinese.  Sino-Japanese  characters  have  been given  underneath  each  term  in  the  table; we should  note  that  the  words  often share  characters,  although  pronounced  with  a  'Chinese  reading' (on-yomi) or Japanese  reading' (kun-yomi). Loanwords,  of course,  are  given  in  the katakana syllabary  typically  used  to  write  borrowed  foreign  items.

Here, however, it should be noted that the degree of correspondence  between the  three  terms  in  each  row is by no  means  precisely synonymous. As I have discussed  in  Chapter  2 and  elsewhere, the  three  terms for  rice are not  exactly interchangeable,  but  are  governed  by somewhat  subtle  collocational  and stylistic  constraints  (see  Stanlaw,  1992d). Similarly, the  use of all of the  other 'triplets'  set out  Table  3.7  appear  to  be  governed  by similar  constraints,  even when  there  appears  to be less than  complete  consensus  among Japanese  who agree on  the nature  of such constraints. Some loans are restricted  in  meaning or  usage,  as in  the  case  of rangeeji ('language'),  which  appears  restricted  to the  phrase rangeeji rabo ('language  laboratory'). The word hyuuman ' human' has a range of reference  restricted  to affection  and warmth, as Kamiya  (1994) illustrates with  the  following  example: Kanojo ni wa hyuuman-na  atatakami ga

arimashita. 'There  was a human warmth  about  her'  (Kamiya,  1994:  135). By contrast, sutoriito ('street')  may be paired with a number of  semantically-related items, as in sutoriito wookaa ('streetwalker'), sutoriitopiipuru ('street  people'), sutoriitopafoomansu ('street  performance') (Horiuchi,  1999). These  examples illustrate  one  important  point  about  the  incorporation (and  creation)  of English  words within  the Japanese  language  system. A significant  number  of these  appeared  to have existing synonyms within  the Japanese  language,  and yet  such ' synonyms'  are  not  necessarily  isomorphic  in  terms  of  their connotational  and  denotational  meanings.  Nevertheless,  the  existence  of broadly  equivalent  items  provides  the  language  with  added  lexical  resources including  a measure  of  'bilingual  creativity'  (Kachru,  1986)  which  is directly supplied  through  the addition  and  incorporation  of such  'foreign'  vocabulary into  the Japanese  language.

## Summary

This chapter has attempted  to achieve a number  of aims. In  the early sections of  the  chapter  I set  out  to  provide  the  reader  with  an  understanding  of  the history  of  linguistic  contact  between  the Japan  and  Europe  from  the  midsixteenth  century onwards, and  in  the  later sections I provide  a short  account of  the  linguistic  processes  and  linguistic  features  relevant  to  a  consideration of  contemporary Japanese-English  linguistic  contact.  The  early  European visitors  to Japan  included  the  Portuguese  and  Spanish  (from  1554), and  the Dutch  and  the English  (from  1600). After  the failure  of the  British  East  India Company in Japan  in  1623, and  the expulsion  of the Jesuits in  1633, only  the Dutch  were  permitted  to continue  their  residence  and  trade  in  the Japanese islands, and  were  thus able  to maintain  a singularly privileged  presence  until the  mid-nineteenth  century.  As a  result,  the  study  of  the  West,  including Western languages, became associated with  'Dutch  studies' as well as the work of  the oranda-tsuuji (Dutch  interpreters)  for  over  two  hundred  years.  The American  expeditions  to Japan  under  Commodore  Perry  in  1853 and  1854 not  only  opened Japan  to Western  trade,  but  also  to  the  English  language. Following  the  fall  of  the  Tokugawa  shogunate  government  in  1867 and  the era  of  Meiji Japan,  the  learning  and  teaching  of  English  became  a  national concern  that persisted  until the  1930s. As well as scholarly varieties of English, a number of restricted pidgins also developed, including the Yokohama  Dialect of  the  late  nineteenth  century,  and  the  'Bamboo  English'  that  arose  in  the context  of post-Second  World War Japan  in  the  late  1940s and  early  1950s.

Over  the  last  fifty  years,  the  popularity  of  English  in Japan  has  risen dramatically, but this has found  greatest expression  not in the creation  of large groups of 'native' or 'near-native' speakers of the language, but rather  through the  nativization  of English  loanwords  (and  English-based  neologisms)  within

the Japanese  language  system.  Structurally,  such  loanwords  are  embedded within  the Japanese  language  through  a number  of processes, resulting in  the phonological  modification  and  morphological  modification  of loans, as well as  in  a  range  of  grammatical  and  semantic  features  in Japanese.  The explication  of  both  the  historical  aspects  of  language  contact,  as well  as  the contemporary linguistics of  Japanese-English  language  contact in this  chapter is intended  to inform  the  discussion  of a wide range  of cultural  and  linguistic issues which follows  in  the succeeding chapters of this book. In  Chapter  4, we will move on  to consider  the impact of English on  the Japanese writing system.

## The  Japanese writing system  and English

## Introduction

In  this  chapter 1 I will  discuss  the Japanese  writing  system,  and  show  how  it has  been  influenced  by English.  I will  discuss  the  structure  of  the  special katakana syllabary used,  among  other  things, as a way to write  foreign  words or  names  phonetically  in Japanese.  I will not  give  a complete  account  of  its development  at this point,  however, as much  of this story is connected  to  the role  of  the woman's  'voice'  in Japanese  literary history. This will be  discussed in  more  detail  in  Chapter  6.

Here I will argue  that due  to the influence  of foreign  loanwords - mostly from  English  - the  traditional katakana syllabary  has  developed  at  least  42 new  'innovative'  symbols.  These  changes  have  occurred  not  only  to accommodate  changes  in  phonology,  but  also  for  various  other  social  and cognitive  reasons.  I will show  that  even  loanwords  often  have  an  'older'  and 'newer'  way of  being  written,  demonstrating  again  some  of  the  interesting creativity  of Japanese  people  using loanwords. Finally, this  chapter  prepares the way for  the  discussion  to follow  in  the  next  chapters, where  this  creativity is found  to be  exploited  in  even  more  graphic  areas.

However,  this  chapter  does  more  than just  show  how  phonological innovation  due  to English influences  the Japanese language. It also shows how the  special katakana script  acts  as  mediator  between  things  foreign and domestic. Katakana words  are  really  representations  of  blendings,  not indicators  of  boundaries. Katakana words  are  markers  of  daily  emotional content  of  various  kinds,  foreign  items  being just  one  instance.  So  using katakana to write Japanese  English  is a special case of how katakana is used  in the whole Japanese-language  social and linguistic schema. And knowing when, and  how, to use katakana -  including  the  'innovative' katakana -  goes  deep into  the  heart  of Japanese  cognition.

## History

Before  the  fifth  century  AD the Japanese  language  had  no  real  writing  system to  speak  of,  but  by  the  mid-sixth  century,  when  the  Chinese  began  to  bring Buddhism  to  the  islands,  Chinese  ideographic  characters  made  their  first appearance.  They  soon  became  applied  to  things  besides  religious  texts.  Thus, a  Chinese  character  could  be  used  for  three  things:  (1)  to write  and  represent some  object  or  idea  that  was  new  and  brought  in  from  the  Asian  mainland, using  the Chinese pronunciation of the new  item as  a  basis  for  the  reading  of  the character  in Japanese;  (2)  to write  and  represent  some  object  or  idea  that  was i n d i g e n o u s  to Japan,  using  the Japanese  pronunciation of the object as a  basis  for the  reading  of  the  character  in Japanese;  and  (3)  to write  and  represent  some object  or  idea  that  was  indigenous  to Japan,  but  using  a Chinese pronunciation of the characters a  basis  for  reading  the  character  in  Japanese. 2

Today,  remnants  of all  these  usage  are  still  extant,  though  initially  making such  a  complex  system  work  in  practice  was  quite  complicated.  To  help  make the  isolating  Chinese  language  match  the  aggultinative  structure  of Japanese, over  the  course  of  some  two  hundred  years,  two  syllabary 3 systems  -  based on  the  structure  of  selected  Sino-Japanese  characters  -  were  devised  to  write Japanese  phonetically.  The  cursive hiragana forms  were  based  on  abbreviated versions  of  complete  Chinese  characters.  The  angular katakana forms  were taken  from  parts  of  Chinese  characters.  For  example,  the Japanese  syllable ru could  be  written  as  follows  in hiragana and katakana, 4 with  their ancestral Chinese kanji character  given  to  the  right:

The  Appendix  gives a  more  detailed  account  of  the Japanese  syllabary  system. I will focus  here  strictly on  the katakana symbols, the  ones  most  often  associated with  foreign  and  borrowed  elements  in Japanese.

## The  appearance  of 42  'innovative' katakana

The  use  of katakana in Japanese  is quite  common,  and  Figure A.3  (see  p.  305) shows  the  complete  list  of  the  107  traditional katakana symbols. What  is  most interesting,  however,  has  been  how  readily  this  particular  syllabary  system  can adopt  and  take  in  new  forms.  As  can  be  seen  from  Figure  A.3,  there are numerous  potential  sounds  in  the  chart  that  do  not  have  any t r a d i t i o n a l manifestations in  J a p a n e s e .  As Japanese  came  into  contact  with other

l a n g u a g e s ,  or  as  the  language  changed,  new  syllabary  symbols  have  been created  to  accommodate  these  changes.  Generally,  what  is done  is that  some older  established  syllable  symbol  becomes  modified  to  take  a  'diacritic'  of  sorts -  usually  one  of  the  other  symbols  written  in  smaller  form  and  set  off  to  the bottom  right  of  the  original  character.  For  example,  when  f-sounds  began  to be  used  more  and  more  in Japanese,  the  way  to  write  this  was  to  take t h e symbol  for fu ( 7 ) and  pair  it  u p  with  smaller  vowel  signs.  Thus,  the  syllable FA would  be  written as fu ( 7 ) plus  a  smaller  version  of  a  ( 7 ) ,  thus,  giving fa ( 7 7 ) .  This  has  been  quite  a  productive  system,  and  has  allowed  many  new forms  to  be  readily  brought  into  the  language.

Table  4.1  is again  a  tabular katakana listing  of  the  sounds  of Japanese,  but it differs  quite  significantly  from  the  standard  50-sound  charts  traditionally  used in Japan  as  discussed  in  the  Appendix  (Figure  A.l,  see  p.  302).

Across  the  top  run  21  initial  sounds  (usually  consonants  like  k-, g-,  and  so on).  Down  the  side  lie  the  five  standard  vowels (-a,-i,-u,-e,  -0), a n d  two  sets  of semi-vowels (-ya,  -yu, a n d -yo; plus -wa,  -wi,  -we, and -wo); t h ese,  of  course,  pair with  the  initials  as  before.  Instead  of  the  50-sound  table,  this  is  theoretically  a 252-syllable  array. 5

In  various  written  sources  and  discussions  with  informants  I  have  found at  least  42  new  syllable  symbols  which  I will  call  'innovative' katakana. These are  new  symbols  that  do  not  appear  on  the  corresponding  chart  of hiragana syllables,  but  are  restricted  to  writing  loanwords  and  foreign  names.  For example,  the  f-sounds  mentioned  in  the  previous  paragraph  would  all  be considered  to be  innovative katakana. They have no hiragana equivalent. 6 These new  innovative katakana forms  are  shaded  in  Table  4.1.

Two points  should  be  mentioned.  First,  in  some  places,  in  trying  to  follow t h e  regularities  of  the  50-sound  system  as  much  as  possible,  a  few  syllable symbols  could  appear  in  more  than  one  place;  in  these  cases,  an  arrow  points to  their  appearance  in  the  next  row  or  column.  Second,  in  the  final  column on  Table  4.1  (just  before  the  symbol  for  the  general  syllabic  n-sound),  there are  listed  a  n u m b e r  of  smaller katakana glyphs.  These  are  the  symbols  that are  generally  used  to  modify  the  other kana symbols  across  that  row;  these often  produce  newer  innovative katakana.

Table  4.2  is  an  estimate  of  the  first  appearance  of  an  innovative katakana f o r m .  These  estimates  are  based  on  reference  works  and etymological dictionaries,  as  well  as  other  statistics  gathered  by  the  National  Language Research  Institute  (cf.  Sanseidoo,  1999; Arakawa,  1977; Yoshizawa  and  Ishiwata, 1979; Kokuritsu  Kokugo  Kenkyuujo,  1964, 1971, 1972,  1973, 1974). Also, I  have t a k e n s o m e  from t h e  popular  media  myself ( magazines, newspapers, advertisements,  etc.).  In  any  case,  as  there  is no  accurate  data  available  as  yet, Table  4.2  must  be  thought  of  as  only  an  estimate.

## Reasons  for  the  'innovative' katakana script  reform  and  changes in Japanese  orthography

The  development  of  the  new  'innovative' katakana syllabaries  -  and  their concomitant  new  symbols  -  has  actually  received  little  attention  in  the literature. Histories of the Japanese writing system  (e.g. Habein,  1984; Seeley, 1984,  1991)  fail  to  mention  anything  about katakana after  their  original development  a millennium  ago. When  changes in the writing system or  script reform  are  discussed,  it is often  in  terms  of  two main  themes:  the  proposals to change or restrict the number  of Sino-Chinese kanji characters, or  attempts to  change Japanese  completely  to a system of romanization,  as we have  seen in  the  last  chapter.

Both  of  these  can  be  summed  up  quickly.  Since  the  Second  World  War, the  number  of  'official'  characters  prescribed  by the  government  has  been limited  to some  2,000. Attempts at romanization  - though  revived  somewhat

in  the  1960s  and  1970s  with  the  growth  of  automated  data  processing  and computers  -  have  remained  more  of  an  intellectual  curiosity  than  anything to  be  taken  too  seriously.  A  close  analogy  might  be  the  advocacy  of  the  use  of Esperanto  in  the  West:  perhaps  a  good  idea,  but  destined  never  to  happen. Some  (e.g.  Unger,  1987)  have  argued,  in  fact,  that Japan's  'Fifth  Generation' computer  revolution  has  not  been  a sinister  plot  by  Japan,  Inc.'  to  financially conquer  the  information  world,  but  instead  is just  an  attempt  to  be  able  to use  computers  via  the  very complex Japanese  writing  system, just  as  Westerners can  use  their  everyday  language  and  orthography  when  using  their  computers.

Little  has  been  said  about  how  the  two  syllabaries  have  fared  in  the  face of  language  change  and  language  contact. Katakana, of  course  -  the  de  facto script  used  to  write  foreign  names  and  phrases  -  bears  the  heaviest  burden. I  suggest  that  there  are  at  least  eight  reasons  for  the  development  of  the  new ' i n novative' katakana.

## Contact with foreign languages

The  general  assumption  is  that  'innovative' katakana have  developed  due  to influence  from  Western  languages. That  is, as people  have  tried  to more  closely approximate  the  sounds  of,  say,  English,  new  glyphs  have  become  needed  to capture  them.  There  is absolutely  no  doubt  that  this  is true.  Even  a  brief  look at Japanese  English  textbooks  even  as  late  as  the  1970s  show  that  trying  to accurately  write  the  'pronunciation'  of  English  in  the Japanese  syllabary  is  an impossibility.  For  one  thing,  phonologically Japanese  is  a  CONSONANT-VOWEL, CONSONANT-VOWEL language  (which  of course  is reflected  in  the kana). Secondly, however,  there  are  numerous  sounds  (such  as voiced  labio-dental  [v]  sounds) that  are  not  native  to Japanese.  The  use  of  'innovative' katakana are  attempts to  ameliorate  both  limitations.  For  example,  to  transcribe  the  English  word ( p h o t o g r a p h i c ) ' f i l m ' , historically  four syllables  were  used: fu-i-ru-mu (7  4 JUA). The  new  innovative katakana syllable fi (7  4 ) ,  as  in fi-ru-mu (7  4 lb A), i n t r o d u c e s  a  new  sound-syllable  into  the  language,  and also attempts  to  more  closely  capture  the  rhythm  of  the  English  initial mora (where no  diphthong  is  used).

Many  believe  that  is  the  whole  story;  I  suggest,  however,  that  things  are much  more  complex.  For  one  thing,  as we will  see  shortly,  Fukuzawa  Yukichi as  early  as  1860  tried  to  introduce  new katakana to  reflect  pronunciations  he felt  were  closer  to  native  English.  However,  for  various  reasons, t h e s e innovations  were  rejected after his  'improvements'  had  been  commonplace  in Japanese  for  decades.  But  before  I discuss  this, I want  to  examine  seven  other factors t h a t  we  need  to  consider  as  to  why  innovative katakana become i n c o r p o r a t e d  i nto  the  language.

## Few  official restrictions

One  important  fact  about Japanese  ought  to  be  mentioned  here:  there  is  no Japanese  equivalent  of  the Academie Francaise which  establishes  language  policy or  polices  usage.  Indeed,  there  are  often  government  statements  -  either  by i n d i v i d u a l  officials  or  as  institutional  pronouncements  -  that  regularly condemn  loanwords and  language  'pollution'  (usually oddly enough  filled  with t h e  very  borrowings  they  are  condemning).  But  these  have  had  no legal sanctions  or  repercussions  (except  for  a  brief  time  during  the  Second  World War),  there  is really  nothing  to  theoretically  stop  the  creation  of  new  syllabary sounds  and  the  symbols  to  write  them.

## Individual creativity and  sociolinguistic factors

A  third  important  reason  for  the  use  of  innovative katakana is  i n dividual creativity  as  an  agent  in  the  development  of  new  sounds  and  'spellings'.  One Japanese  colleague,  for  example,  discussed  with  me  at  length  how  some  new t e r m  they  were  going  to  borrow  from  English  should  be  'spelled'  in katakana. This  was  no  small  concern;  after  the  word  would  appear  in  their  publication, t h e r e  was  a  g o o d  c h a n c e  t hat  this  would  be the way  this  word  might  be  used by  others  for  quite  some  time  to  come.  Individuals  -  such  as  cartoonists, advertising  copywriters,  or  even  schoolgirls  writing  on  their  backpacks  -  are free t o  be  idiosyncratic  and  artistic  in  their  use  of  borrowings  and t h e i r phonetic  representations  (see  Chapter  6).  In  fact,  I  am  going  to  argue  later that  it  is  these  different  individual  'spellings'  that  give  the Japanese  writing system  much  of  its  robustness  and  versatility.

## The  influence of  the  syllabary table

As  has  been  shown  in  the  previous  sections, Japanese  folk  and intellectual linguistics  has  been  strongly  dominated  by  the Gojuu-on (Fifty-Syllable) chart (Figure  A.l).  As  new  symbols  have  developed (as,  say,  in  the  process  just described  above),  new  rows  and  columns  have  been  implicitly  added  to  the table  almost  by  default.  Table  4.1, for  example  -  though  actually  used  by  no Japanese  -  might  be  thought  to be  the  logical  result. A glance  at  such  a  table reveals  quickly  that  there  are  many  spaces  or  'holes'  to  be  filled  in.  Innovative katakana could  develop  as  people  either  intentionally  or  unintentionally  try to  develop  new  symbols  to  fit  in  these  spaces.

## Phonological universals

What  is implied  in  the Gojuu-on table  (the  Fifty-Syllable  Sound  Chart,  Figure A.1)  -  and  its  implicit  extended katakana-xersion shown  here  in  Table  4.1  are  several  assumptions  about  how  sound  systems  universally  operate.  Thus, t h e  Fifty-Syllable  Sound  Chart  itself  contains  many  suggestions  as  to  how  it might  be  expanded.  For  example,  in  the  left  column  are  the  theoretical  set of  consonants  in  the  system  matched  with  all  five  possible  vowels.  But  as described  in  the  Appendix  (see  pp.  301-7),  the  k-row  also  has  a  set  of  voiced equivalents  (the  g's),  and  other  initial  consonants  have  voiced  equivalents  as well  (that  is,  the  s's  become  z's;  the  t's  become  d's;  the  p's  become  b's,  etc.).

To  expand  the  original  chart,  then,  is  relatively  simple.  For  example,  to refer  back  to  the  example  of  'film'  just  mentioned  above,  when  the  use  of the ft  (7  4) syllable  became  popular,  other  f-sounds  followed  around  the  same time  (cf.  the  various  dictionary  entries  in  Arakawa  [1977]): fa (7 7), fe  (7 x ) , and/o  ( 7 *). Likewise, when  people  later  decided  to voice  this set, they  created t h e  syllables va  (Or), vi  (O4), vu (O), ve  (OJL), and vo ("J7^),once again, all  h a p p e n i n g  at  about  the  same  time.  Thus,  the Japanese  syllable  chart  itself can  be  an  impetus  for  new  phonological  developments.

## The  influence of  the  romanization systems

As was  mentioned  in  Chapter  3, there  are  several  romanization  systems  used in Japanese. At  the  same  time, Japanese  people  are  often  rather  indeterminate about  how  they  might  'spell'  any  given  loanword  (as, for  example,  when  using a  'conservative'  or  'innovative'  style  to  be  discussed  along  with  Table  4.3  later, or  borrowing  'by  eye'  or  'by  ear'  below).  Sometimes  a  loanword  may  be ' s pelled'  in katakana on  the  basis  of  how  it appears  in  one  of  the  romanization systems.

## The  influence of  Japanese exposure  to  English: Borrowing by  eye

As was mentioned  in  Chapter  3, almost  all Japanese  people  have  at  least  some knowledge  of English  (usually up  to  six years  in junior  high  and  high  school). Most of  this knowledge  of English,  however,  is via the written  word.  Until  quite recently  entrance  examinations  for  high  schools  and  colleges,  for  instance, focused  solely  on  the  reading  of  English;  there  is  still  no  oral  or  aural  parts for  most  of  these  exams.

This  has  important  consequences  as to  how  English  words  are  borrowed, especially  as  it  appears  that  some  foreign  items  have  been  taken  in  visually rather  than  aurally  (at  least  to  some  degree).  For  example,  the  English  word

' n e w s ' is  s p e l l e d in katakana more  closely  to  how  it  is  written  t h a n pronounced  -  in  English.  Though  the  final  consonant  of  this  term  in  English is  actually  voiced  (i.e.  is  a  [-z]  sound),  in Japanese  this  common  loanword  is written nyuusu (-=L-7) with  the  last  syllable  being  voiceless  (based  on  how it  is  spelled  in  English).  Likewise,  the  English  loan  'motto'  is written  as mottoo (^y I-),  with  the Japanese  'double'  (geminated)  consonant,  even t h o u g h t h e r e is  n o  actual  glottal  stop  between t h e two  t's  in t h e  native English pronunciation (see  note  4).  Obviously,  this  is  an  attempt  to  mimic  English spelling  and  not  pronunciation.

It  s h o u l d  be  mentioned,  too,  that Japanese  are  quick  to  adopt  -  and pronounce  as  real  words  -  various  English  acronyms.  One  example  is UFO (meaning,  of course,  'unidentified  flying  object'  in  both Japanese  and  English). This  is  read  by Japanese  as yuufoo (n.-7* - ) , pronouncing  the  English [u] as 'yu, t h e  n a m e  of  the  letter  in  English.

## The  influence of  Japanese exposure  to  English: Borrowing by  ear

While  many  of  the  English  loanwords  taken  into Japanese  are  brought  in  by eye,  many  were  -  and  still  are  -  brought  in  by  ear  as well.  During  the  Meiji Period  (1868-1912),  numerous  words  were  brought  in  this  way  (e.g. kamiya, ' C o m e here'  for  Western  dogs,  as  discussed  in  the  last  chapter). Other examples  include sutoraiki for  ' work  stoppage' (c.  1895;  compare  this to sutoraiku as  in  baseball  'strike',  c.  1926), Merikan for  ' American' (c.  1853), sukaatoiox ' skirt'  (c.  1884),  and mishin for  'sewing  machine'  (c.  1861-1864). The  Taisho  Period  (1912-1926)  brought  in  many  as well, including  the  famous usutaa soosu, ' Worcestershire  sauce'  (c.  1919)  (Arakawa,  1977:  133, 598,  6256,  1362,  1327).

Right  after t h e  Second  World  War  the  new  word jiruba (z/JWi), or ' j i t t e r b u g ' ,  was  not  spelled  as jitabaggu (i/#/\yt?) as  the  J a p a n e s e  would normally  do  if brought  in  by  the  written  word.  Miura  (1979:  78)  believes  this was due  to  the  fact  that  it was  not  intellectuals  who  brought  this  term  into  the l a nguage,  but  prostitutes  and  others  living  near  US  military  bases  during  the Occupation. Purin (7 P, J &gt;), or  'pudding',  is another  example  of a word  brought in  aurally,  though  the  more  common  way  to  spell  this  word  in  the  1990s  is pudingu (~^ir4  y$). Likewise,  a  'U-turn'  is  said  as yuu-taan (zi-^ - y) in Japanese,  clearly  a  loan  brought  in  by  ear  rather  than  eye.

However,  the  connections  between  visual  and  aural  borrowing are complex,  and  it is often  unclear  as to which  source  has  been  more  influential. For  example,  as  mentioned  in  the  last  chapter,  in  the  late  nineteenth  century James  Curtis  Hepburn  wrote  his Japanese-English  dictionaries  and  introduced his  system  of  romanizing Japanese  to  the  world:  the  so-called  Hepburn  System -  or Hebon  shiki in  J a p a n e s e .  But  Miura (1985:  58)  says  the  fact  that t h e

spelling Hebon  (^\T\(&gt;) was used  to  transliterate  his  name  indicates  that  an 'effort  was  made  by  either  him  or  by  people  around  him  to  preserve  the original  pronunciation  of  his  name  as much  as possible'.  He  goes  on  to  say that a century later when two other famous Hepburns became popular in Japan - Katherine Hepburn  and Audrey Hepburn - their last names were put  into katakana as Heppubaan  (^y^A-&gt;) 'which  was  definitely  a  spelling-based pronunciation'.

Another  example  of a loan  that  might  have been  taken  in  either  by eye or  ear  is  that  name  for  one  of  the  most  famous Japanese  places  to  have  a snack  or  lunch,  McDonald's. As discussed  previously,  in Japanese  this  place is  pronounced ma-ku-do-na-ru-do ("7^7 K^JUK),  close  to  the  English  written form  (with  the  usual  nativization  of  the  [-k]  becoming Japanese [-ku-] and the  [-1-] Japanese [-ru-]). But  if  this  were  taken  in  totally  by  eye,  a  likely intuitive  and  acceptable  pronunciation  in Japanese  could  be mu-ku-do-na-rudo-su (1\$  \^i~Jl K7).  On  the  other  hand,  if the  restaurant's  name  had  been strictly an  aural  borrowing we might have had  something like makkudanaruzu (~?y&amp;&amp;j~J\sX), much  closer  to  the  way  it  is  actually  said  in  English  than the  way it  is commonly  written  in Japanese.

So  the  version  we  actually  find  ma-ku-do-na-ru-do  (~?9 K^JUK)  is a bit  of mystery,  being  neither  obviously borrowed  by sight  nor  obviously borrowed  by sound.  It  is  unclear  if  this  spelling  came  from  the  name  of Ranald  MacDonald  - whom we met  in  the  last chapter  as the  first  English teacher  in Japan  in  the  mid-nineteenth  century,  and  whose  name  was commonly  transliterated  as  "7^7 K^"JUK (Makudonarudo) -  or  if  it  was derived  by some  other  fashion.  However,  it is possible  that when  Fujita  Den opened  the  first  McDonald's  restaurants  in Japan  in  1971,  the  written English  phrase  'McDonald's'  was  initially  actually  seen  more  often then heard  (on  signs,  and  in  the Japanese-language  magazine  for  McDonald's customers  at  the  time, Mcjoy) (Ohnuki-Tierney,  1997:  162,  173).  In  any case,  the Nihon  Makudonarudo (McDonald's  Co.  [Japan], Ltd.)  decided  on their  name,  and  that  is  the  one  now  found  on  the  wrapper  of  the biggu maku ('Big  Mac').

These  points  indicate  that Japanese  can  bring  in  loanwords  equally well using inspiration from written sources, or by hearing the term spoken  (whether in  a  classroom or  by  native  speakers).  This,  along  with individual resourcefulness  in creating new spellings, allows for a plethora  of new syllables to  be  brought  into Japanese.

## Why have  particular  innovative katakana developed?

The  above  points  clearly  indicate  that  over  the  course  of  time,  the Japanese orthography  has  been  changing,  often  in  radical  ways. In  fact,  there  is still

disagreement  about  what  is the  correct  'spelling'  of  a loanword.  Actually,  it was  probably  Fukuzawa  Yukichi,  the  Meiji  educator  discussed  in  the  last chapter,  who  was  the  first  to  develop  an  innovative katakana symbol.  He proposed  in  1860  in  his  book Kaei  Tsuugo ('The  Flourishing  of  English Translation')  that  certain  English  borrowings  had  to  be  written  with  a  new character,  the v-sound (0). In  this way, he  transcribed  English words, such  as the  following  (Fukuzawa,  1860  [1958]: 80, 81, 112, 269): 7

| 'vest'      | vesuto     | 2 x 7 h   |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 'heaven'    | hiivinu    | t-047     |
| 'sovereign' | sovuren    | 70\y>     |
| 'seven'     | seevinu    | t-0'47    |
| 'twelve'    | tsuvueruvu | yyjuw     |
| 'voyage'    | vooeji     | W - i y   |

Traditionally  many other  words were written  with  this glyph  for  V.  Some  of these  are:

| 'violin'   | vaiorin   | 07^*V>   |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| 'viola'    | viora     | 0*4*7    |
| 'vitamin'  | vaitamin  | 07J*$L>  |
| 'veil'     | veeru     | VJL-)\,  |
| 'veteran'  | veteran   | OnT7>    |
| 'virgin'   | vaajin    | 07-i»    |

These  days,  however,  all  of  these  words  have  a  more  conservative  spelling alternative  using  the  syllabary for  b-sounds:

| 'violin'   | baiorin   | /U*V>   |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| 'viola'    | biora     | £*7     |
| 'vitamin'  | bitamin   | tf*^>   |
| 'veil'     | beeru     | ^ - ; u |
| 'veteran'  | beteran   | ^ 7 >   |
| 'virgin'   | baajin    | A - v > |

Other words have never been  'spelled'  using the v-symbol, O, but  have always used  the  b-sound  in  spite  of  their  V-pronunciation  in  English.  Often  these words  came  into  the  language  in  the  1940s  and 1950s,  a  time  when phonological  simplification  was emphasized.  Some  of these words  are:

| 'television'   | terebi    | xUtf            |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 'observer'     | obuzaabaa | * 7 i f - / \ - |
| 'service'      | saabisu   | y-ti7           |
| 'vanilla'      | banira    | A - 7           |

What  this  means  is, even  a  century  and  a  half  after  Fukuzawa's  first  proposals, this  new  syllabary  symbol  is not  completely  widespread  (Inoue,  1996:  196-7). That  is, for  'television',  for  example, terebi and  not terevi is  still  found.

In  fact,  it  appears  that,  if  anything,  the  trend  is  becoming  less  radical. Perhaps  one  reason  for  this  is  that,  at  least  for  some Japanese i n f o r m a n t s , excessive  reliance  on  'v'-pronunciations  sounds  affected (e.g.  saying vaiorin instead  of  the  more  mundane baiorin can  be  regarded  as slightly  pretentious). Momose  Chihiro,  a  specialist  in  the Japanese  national  language  says  that  it was between  1945  to  1955  that  the  b-sound  became  more  accepted  and  the  vsound  waned.  In  1952  the  influential  newspaper  the Asahi  Shimbun organized a  committee  which  included  government  officials  from  the  Ministry of  Foreign Affairs  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  to  propose  new  'spellings'  of  certain foreign  terms  with  v-sounds  (H.  Inoue,  1996:  197).  For  example,

| 'Bolivia'   | boribia    | /KUriJ    |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 'Geneva'    | juneebu    | v ZL^-7'  |
| 'Salvador'  | sarubadoru | tNU/K KJU |

Each  of  these  used  to  be  written in  a  style  closer to  a native-speaker's pronunciation:

| 'Bolivia'   | borivia    | ~$ x )047   |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 'Geneva'    | juneevu    | i/=L%>-0    |
| 'Salvador'  | saruvadoru | ^J10 7 KJU  |

It  should  be  noted,  too,  that  some Japanese  loanword  dictionaries  do  not  even have  v-sound  entries  (e.g.  Kaieda,  1997).

Inoue  Hisashi  also  points  out,  however,  that  at  the  same  time  that  these advocates  were  encouraging  the  use  of  b- instead  of  v- syllabaries,  they  also encouraged  the  use  of  other  innovative katakana (1996:  199),  as  seen  in  the examples  below:

| using innovative katakana if 4   | di:   | 'disc'        | disuku         | J r4 7&     |
|----------------------------------|-------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| using innovative katakana 7 4    | fv.   | 'film'        | firumu         | 7 4 )V2x    |
| using innovative katakana 77     | fa:   | 'first class' | faasuto kurasu | 7 7-7 V9z?7 |
| using innovative katakana 7 4    | fi:   | 'feeling'     | fiiringu       | 7 4 - l J>& |
| using innovative katakana 7 x    | fe    | 'fare'        | fea            | 7 x 7       |
| using innovative katakana 7 *    | fo    | 'focus'       | fookasu        | 7* - ti7    |

I n o u e c o m m e n t s t h a t t h e s e  new katakana are  changing  the  Japanese phonological  system,  and  that  the  trend  towards  simplicity  is no  longer  being followed.  He  asks  if after  all  this  time  Fukuzawa's  v-sounds  will  finally  become permanent  members  of  the Japanese  sound  system.

While  there  are  at  least  half  a  dozen  motivations  as  to  how  an  innovative katakana might  be  introduced  into Japanese,  we  are  still  at  a  loss  to  explain why they have  developed  as they did, and  why some  terms become  standardized in  certain  ways.  Some  terms  are  written  in  a  newer  fashion,  while  others  still use  -  or  are  brought  in  using -  a  more  conservative  spelling.  At first  glance, it  appears  that  there  is  no  real  motivation  that  might  be  traced  back to determine  why  one  form  was  chosen  over  the  others.  Some  have  speculated that  it is mere  linguistic  or  historical  accident  that  is the  cause.  Anthropologists and  linguists,  of  course,  are  always  suspicious  of  such  cavalier  dismissals.

Actually  in  modern  Japanese  there  are  hundreds  of katakana t e r ms  that t o d a y  can  be  written  in  either  an  older  traditional  form or  a  m o r e new innovative  style.  Depending  on  an  author  or  an  editor,  either  form  might  be chosen.  Table  4.3  shows just  a  few  such  'minimal  pairs'  of  terms  that  can  be spelled  in both t h e  o l d e r  traditional  way  as well  as  using  the  newer  innovative katakana. On  the  extreme  left  column  is given  the  English  gloss  for  the  pair of  terms.  The  second  column  gives  the  term  as  it  is  spelled  in  the  more conservative  manner.  The  extreme  right  column  gives  the  way  the  term  is spelled  in  the  newer  innovative  way.

I  have  argued  (Stanlaw,  2002)  that  these  data  seem  to  coincide  with  the semantic  relation  of  co-extension  described  by  MacLaury  (1997)  for  colour naming.  That  is, two phonologically  similar  names  apparently  compete  for  the same  ostensive  referent.  This  is not  a  case  of  inclusion;  for  example,  a hire ( t U)  -  the  Anglo-French  word  'fillet'  written  in  the  conservative  style  -  is  not a  kind  of fire (7  4  \s), but  a  'fillet'  written  using  innovative katakana.

Nor  is  innovative  versus  traditional katakana a  case  of  synonymy.  That might  be  like  asking  in  English  if  'violin'  is  synonymous  with  'fiddle'.  Can bluegrass  music, then,  be  played  on  a violin?  Did  Bartok write fiddle  concertos? In  J a p a n e s e l o a n w o r d  usage,  matters  might  be  even  more  distinct. For example,  a fuirumu (7^0UA) in t h e t r a d i t i o n a l  spelling  always  refers to photographic  'film'  (not  the  cinematic  kind);  the  innovative katakana word firumu (7-rJUA)  literally  means  the  same  thing.  However,  if  this  innovative ' film'  spelling  is used,  it  can  depict  things  not  purely  photographic,  such  as  a 'film  library'  firumu-raiburarii (7  4)\/l\ 7&lt;i~J7 U -).  I  have  even  seen  this spelling  used  in pinku firumu ( t ° &gt; ^ 7  4)\/Ix), ' p i n k  film'  or  erotic  movie. These  differences  are  not  always  clear,  even  in  context;  nor  are i n f o r m a n t s always  cognizant  of  their  intent  when  spelling  words  in  a  certain  way,  as  seen in  Table  4.4.

## Conclusion

So  what  does  all  this  mean?  I  believe  the  commonly-accepted notion of katakana being  a  marker  of  'foreignness'  or  something  on  the  periphery  is

mistaken. Katakana words are core, everyday, expressions. It appears from  the examples above that every katakana word  is - or has the  potential  to be - a real  native Japanese  lexeme. Katakana words  are  markers  of blendings,  not boundaries. Katakana words  are  markers  of  emotional  content  of all kinds: onomatopoeia,  sentence-final  particles, slang,  tag questions, and loanwords. So using katakana to write Japanese  English  is a special  case  of how katakana is used  in  the Japanese-language  cultural and  linguistic schema. And  knowing when, and  how, to use katakana reflects  much  about Japanese  cognition.

There  are  many  examples  of  the  use  of katakana being  a creation  of or  a marker  of - this blending process. Indeed, we can  even see this  process at  work  in  the  'invention'  of katakana a  millennium  ago  described  at  the beginning  of  this  chapter.  We  saw  in  Chapter  3  how  containers  holding traditional Japanese  ingredients  (such  as soy sauce or vinegar)  could  be  held in a botoru (the  English  loanword  'bottle')  or a bin (the  native Japanese  term). I  suggest  that  this  indeterminacy  shows  that katakana mark  the  cultural  and linguistic  overlap  of  Japanese  and  outside  cognitive  systems. That  is, they  are blends  -  of  periphery  and  core,  nativeness  and  foreignness,  inside  and outside.

A similar  thing  can  be  said  about  the  different  ways of  'spelling'  certain loanwords such  as 'violin'. This spelling with  a  [f&gt;]  sound  or  a  [v-] is not just a matter of simplification  or trying to make a better approximation  of a native sound.  It  is  a  creative  act,  as  much  as  anything,  and  represents  a  meeting ground  of  language  contact,  acculturation and resistance,  and  individual resourcefulness. Actually, it could be argued that if more loanwords like  'violin' or  'seven'  start getting written  (and  pronounced)  with  [v-] sounds, this would be not some new, better, appreciation  of English phonology, but would be  an appreciation  of  a Japanese  response  to  the  introduction  of  such  terms  that was already made  a century  ago.

Indeed,  it  might  be  said  that  one  of  the  reasons katakana-kotoba (i.e. 'foreign  words',  but  most  of  the  time  meaning  'Japanese  English')  is  so sensitive  a  subject  is  that  what  is being  discussed  are  'real'Japanese  terms, within  the Japanese  cognitive  system. Discussing katakana-kotoba, then,  means discussing what it means  to be Japanese. These  issues will be  discussed  again in  Chapter  11 when  we examine  the  role  of  English  in Japanese  notions  of race  and  identity.  In  the  meantime,  what we are  left  with,  then,  are  cases  of social/cognitive  factors  interacting  with  the  standards  of  graphemics  and individual  creativity. These  interactions  become  even  more  interesting  when we look at Japan's  'Empire  of Signs' in  Chapter  7.

## The  poetics  of English in Japanese pop  songs and  contemporary verse

## Introduction

In  the  fall  of  1995, I was invited  to  a party  held  by the Japanese  students  at my university  in  the  Midwest  of  the  USA, and,  as might  be  expected  at  any Japanese  party, I was asked to sing a song. 1 'Let's  do Diamonds,' I said,  naming a song which  had been  a big hit for  the pop group Princess Princess. This  song, like many other con  temporary J-Pop songs, relies heavily on  English words  and phrases  interspersed  in  the  lyrics.  Soon  a  chorus  of  voices joined  in,  with everyone  seeming  to  know  the  words  by  heart,  and  singing  along  with enthusiasm  and joy. As on  other  occasions, I was forcibly  struck  by how  these young students seemed  so moved by these lyrics, and  again  moved  to  ponder the  role  of  the  English  language  (and  Japanese  English')  in  articulating  the experiences  and  desires  of these young  people.

I was also  in Japan  soon  after  Tawara  Machi's  best-selling  book  of tanka poems, Sarada  Kinenbi ('Salad  Memorial  Day'),  was  released. 2 The  'salad' phenomenon  was sweeping  the  country,  and  this young  high  school  teacher became an instant celebrity, attracting thousands of female fans her age. Inside the  book,  were  pre-addressed  postcards  to Tawara,  that  her  fans  could  fill  in and  send  to  her,  with  messages  of  their  hopes,  fears,  and joys.  Hundreds  of thousands of these tanka postcards were mailed back. One of the most striking features  of Tawara's poems was the extensive use of English words  embedded in  this  form  of  traditional  verse, with  images  of  a young  couple's coffee time, the corner McDonald's, and  lovers standing on  the decks of cruise ships. Again, I  considered  the  implications  of this use of English,  this time  imbricated  in  a classic Japanese  poetic  form.

At first  glance, it might appear  that  this use of English  is largely the  result of importation;  that  is, as Western  rock  music  is marketed  in Japan,  English, in  the  form  of  'loanwords', is also imported.  This, I believe, is a  simplification. First,  I  would  assert,  the  English  found  in Japanese  pop  music  may  be explained  more  accurately  by reference  to  'nativization'  than  rather  than

' i mportation' (Stanlaw,  1990a;  1990b).  The  English  words  used  are  often creative  and  critical Japanese  (not American  or  British)  poetic  devices  which allow songwriters, and even some poets, an access to a wider range of allusions, images, metaphors,  and  technical  possibilities  than  is available  from  'purely' Japanese  linguistic  sources. Whether  it  is Princess Princess singing  about  the diamond images  of Japanese  adolescence,  or finding  the today-only bargains in the modern tanka poems of Tawara Machi, such examples suggest that English now plays an  increasingly  important  role  in  contemporary Japanese  popular culture.

Traditionally,  one  of the  functions  of popular  music in Japan  has been  to express a social consciousness, and  to present social commentaries. Early folk songs  often  lamented  the  life  of  the  peasant  or  praised  their  work.  Popular music today is still an instrument  of social commentary. For example, in  1979, when  the women's liberation  movement was beginning  to take hold  in Japan, the male pop star Sada Masashi released a song entitled Kanpaku Sengen ('The Royal  Proclamation'),  detailing  the  responsibilities  of  a dutiful  wife,  which included  getting  up  before  her  husband,  being  a  good  cook,  and  always looking  lovely. Unexpectedly,  the  record  became  a big hit,  especially  among women, possibly because  of the soft  sensitive image  of the singer.  In fact,  the song  itself  was not  a  male  chauvinist  rant  but  a genuine  social  commentary on  roles  (and  insecurities)  of  the  sexes  at  the  time.  In  the J-pop of  recent decades, English  has also come to play a role in glossing such concerns, and  I attempt  to come  to grips with  this  below.

In  this  chapter,  I  examine  some  of  the  effects  of  this  extensive  use  of English  words  in Japanese  popular  music  and  poetry.  I argue  that  a  mixture of  English  words  to  such  cultural  forms  is not  a  'distracting'  or  'polluting element'  (as this has been  characterized by some commentators), but is instead a vital  part  of  contemporary Japanese  aesthetics, particularly  in  the  realm  of popular  culture. More specifically,  I consider  the  possible motivations for  the use of English by male singers such as Kuwata Keisuke of the Southern All Stars, female  singers such  as Matsutooya Yumi, Matsuda Seiko and Takeuchi  Mariya, the  pop  duet Wink, and  the  group Princess Princesss. In  addition,  I shall  also examine  the  'salad  poems'  of Tawara  Machi. 3

## English  images  and  metaphors  in Japanese  pop  songs

Contemporary Japanese  popular  music often  uses English words and  phrases as images or metaphors to express various forms of social commentary.  Kuwata Keisuke, the lead singer of the Southern All Stars, is one  of the  most  influential rock songwriters in Japan  today and  many of his lyrics include  English  words and  phrases, various forms  of  Japanese  English, and forms  of 'private'  English created  individualistically by himself, as when he sings  (in English) I don't want

to be the  one you  love /  Something's going  to be better today (from  the  album, Tiny Bubbles; see  also Southern  All  Stars Songbook, Tokyo: Kyogakusha  Music  Publishers Co.,  Ltd.).

In  another  song C-Choo Kotoba ni  Go-Yoojin ('Be  Careful  of  C-chord  Words), he  voices  the  random  thoughts  of  a  young  man  hurt  by  love,  releasing  his frustrations,  and  trying  to  make  sense  out  of  what  has  happened.  The first few  stanzas  of  the  song  express  the  singer's  frustration  both  at  being jilted  by his  lover  and  his  sexual  frustration, expressing  his  thoughts  in  a  creative mixture  of Japanese  and  English  thus:

Tamanya makin'  love soo denakya hand  job Yume de Vm so sad Gutto kurushiku  all night

Sometimes  I'm making love but  if I don't  it's hand job In  a dream I'm  so sad It's  a stabbing  pain all night

Another  popular  female aidoru (idol)  in Japan  is Matsuda  Seiko, who  has remained  popular  for  a  number  of  decades,  re-inventing  herself  in  pace  with the  changing  fashions  of  the  music  industry  (Stanlaw,  2000b).  One  device  she uses  to  continually  re-invent  herself  is  English,  as  in  one  of  her  best-selling albums, Squall, which  was  released  in  the  early  1980s  and  is  still selling consistently.  The  title  song  in  this  album  skilfully  presents  a  n u m b e r of r o m a n t i c t r o p i c a l - i s l a n d i mages,  while  simultaneously  playing  with t h e metaphor  of  a  'squall' (or sukooru), which,  perhaps  contrary  to  Western expectations,  is used  to refer  to  the  brimming  over  of sexual  passion.  The  song begins  with  an  introduction  using  two  lines  of  English  (/ wish  shining days /1 wish  shining eyes .  .  . ) ,  a n d  after  this,  each  refrain  begins  with  the  phrase Oh sukooru ('Oh  squall!').  It  is  interesting  that  the  kind  of  metaphor  used  here  is drawn  from  Japanese  rather  than  traditional  anglophone  culture;  rain often douses  the  flames  of  passion  in  English  poetry  and  songs.

Another  important  female  pop  star  in Japan  is Matsutooya Yumi, who  has been  called  the  voice  of  the  'new  generation'  of Japanese  young  women  from their  twenties  to  their  fifties.  As one  informant  told  me,  'Yuming  speaks  to  all Japanese  women.'  As well  as writing  her  own  material, Yuming  also  writes  for other  performers,  including  Matsuda  Seiko.  Yuming's  song Dandiraion ('Dandelion',  see  Chapter  2)  has  a  hybrid  quality,  culturally  and  linguistically, t h a t  is  typical  of  many  of  her  songs.  Matsutooya  Yumi  is  now  well  into her forties,  but,  despite  her  age,  is still  a  spokeswoman  of  her  times. According  to her  1984  autobiography Ruuju no Dengon ('The  Message  of  Rouge'),  Yuming was  a  middle-class  girl  who  had  an  introverted  adolescence,  and  a  quality  of i n t r o s p e c t i o n  certainly  manifests  itself  in  her  songs. Japanese  English finds expression  in  many  of  her  songs,  including Pearl Pierce (Japanese  English  for ' p i e r c e d  pearl  earrings'),  from  the  album  of  the  same  name.  Two  lines  in  the refrain  of  this song  are: Broken heart saigo no yoake /  Broken heart saigo no jealousy,  / which  translate  as  'Broken  heart  the  last  daybreak'  and  'Broken  heart [my]

last  j e a l o u s  [ moment]'. The  song goes on  to describe  the  breakup  of two lovers, occasioned  by the  man's  infidelity.  Instead  of making  a big scene,  the  girl  leaves her  lover  calmly  in  the  morning,  but  leaves  one  of  her  pearl  earrings  under the  bed  for  the  new  girlfriend  to  find.  Since  the  early  1970s Yuming  has  been i n s t r u m e n t a l in t h e nyuu myuujikku ('new  music')  movement,  which  has reacted  against  the  predictable  and  often  childish  sounds  of  teen  pop,  to  tackle t h e mes  in  a  m o r e  adult  fashion,  as  exemplified  here. 4

## The  motivations  for  English  in Japanese  pop  music

This  section  of  the  chapter  attempts  to  examine  the  motivations  for t h e widespread  use  of English  in Japanese  pop  songs. Based  on  my own  research,  a number  of  distinct  yet  overlapping  explanations  suggest  themselves for discussion,  including:  (i)  the  use  of  English  as  an  'audacious'  device;  (ii)  as  a ' s ymbolic'  device;  (iii)  as  a  'poetic'  device;  (iv)  as  an  'exotic'  device;  (v)  as  a means  of  creating  'new  structural  forms';  (vi)  as  a  means  of  'relexifying' and 're-exoticizing'  the Japanese  language,  (vii)  the  use  of English  to express  aspects of modern Japanese  consumer  culture; and  (viii)  use of English words to  express images  of  domestic  life  in Japan.  I shall  discuss  each  of  these  in  turn.

One  of  the  most  striking  things  that  English  loanwords  can  do  in Japanese songs  and  poetry  is  to  be ' a u d a c i o u s ' ,  and  to  provide  daring l i n g u i s t i c resources,  which  can  sometimes  express  an  expanded  symbolic  vocabulary. One  good  example  of  such  use  of  audacious  language  is found  in  the  song Namida-o misenaide ('Boys  Don't  Cry')  from  the  female  pop  duo Wink, which employs  the  repeated  English  refrains  of Boys  don't  cry and Sick-sick-sick (see Figure  5.1  on  p.  106).  This  song  was  a  major  hit  in  1990,  and  was  even  voted best  pop  song  of  the  year  at  the Japanese  equivalent  of  'The  Grammys'.  The song  deals  with  the  breakup  of  a  young  couple,  a  heartbroken girl  and somewhat  callous young  man.  In  an  interview,  one  informant,  a Tokyo  woman in  her  thirties,  expressed  her  feelings  about  the  song,  and  the  way  English  is used  throughout  the  lyrics,  in  the  following  way:

This girl was dumped,  obviously. But if she was really dumped  or really hurt, she would be miserable (kakko-warui, 'wretched',  'unattractive'). But  inserting this  phrase sick-sick-sick,  boys  don't  cry, it  looks  like  the  situation  is just  some kind  of  a  modern  love  game.  So  even  if she  says,  T am  feeling  such  pain', she  is not  really  miserable (kakko-warui) .  If  this  was an enka-type of  song  [a traditional Japanese  ballad], she  would  be  really  devastated.  The  feelings would  be  stronger  and  deeper.  The  singer  would  feel  more  deeply.  This  is not  the  kind  of love that  they sing about  in enka songs: 'I'm  going  to die',  or ' I'm,  going  to  kill you'  or  something  like  that.  The  English  loanwords  give this song a feel  that  this is a kind  of love game - some kind of a new  feeling:

I'm dumped,  and  I'm  sad,  you  know.  I'm sad.  But this is  a dorai ('unsentimental'  or  'dry')  type  of  feeling.  We  do  not  see  she  is  cold  or unsentimental (dorai) or  that  she  doesn't  care; in  fact,  she  says, T love you, I love  you,  I  love  you.'  But,  this  is  for  a  new  type  of  people  -  loving  and dumping  and  being  dumped.  It is a new type of game. For  them,  this is an adult  type  of  love;  actually,  a  mature  love,  a Western-type  of  love.  So  this Japanese enka-fee\ing is miserable, pitiful (kakko-warusa). But this person  here doesn't  show  that  she  is  a  miserable  person.  She  does  not  feel  she  is unattractive.  The  English  makes  me  think  this.  [.  . .] Yes, the  meaning  here is modern  love. She  is dumped  but  she  is not kawaisoo ('pathetic', 'pitiful'). She is going to go out with another  [. . .] maybe by the next day!  [. . .]  because she  is a modern  girl. I can  only keep  thinking  of  that  [in  this  song].

For  this  informant  then,  the  use  of  English  to  describe  the  girl's  view  of t he  love  affair  is  n o t  only  'audacious'  (in  the  sense  of  'bold',  'daring' etc.) but  is  also  sufficiently  nonJapanese,  compared  to  the  traditional enka ballad form  as  to  allow  for  new  representational  and  symbolic  modes  of  expression. 5 The  girl  is sick-sick-sick when  she  considers  her  boyfriend's  lack  of feelings (Boys don't  cry), but  despite  her  continual  refrain  of  heartache,  the  use  of  English here  provides  the  clue  that  this  is  a  Western-style  romance,  and  that  this modern  Japanese  Miss  will  bounce  right  back  and  find  another boyfriend, ' maybe  by  the  next  day',  in  the  words  of  our informant.

There  are  other  instances  in  Wink's Boys Don't  Cry song  where  English  is used  to  extend  the  representational  and  symbolic  vocabulary  of Japanese.  For i n s t a n c e ,  t h e  girl  in  the  song  uses  the  English  p r o n o u n ' y o u' as  a  t e r m of address  to  her  boyfriend  in  line  2  of  the  song: You yureru jueru-na hoshi-zora  ni ('you,  swaying  in  the jewel-like  starry  sky').  The  use  of  an  English  l oanword pronoun  suggests  two  readings.  First,  that  the Japanese  equivalent  second person  pronoun anata is  too  intimate  a  choice  for  a  situation  where  a  break› up  is  taking  place (anata after  all  is  the  address  term  used  by  a  wife  to  her husband).  Second,  that  the  choice  of you here  is  to  sound  conspicuous,  or even  accusatory,  as it opens  each  refrain  of the  song. A number  of other  words in  the  song  may  also  serve  similar  functions,  including goodbye a n d my  love. According  to  my  informants,  the  use  of  the  English  loanword goodbye here sounds  more  final  than  the Japanese sayoonara, and  they  also  claim  that  there is  n o  exact  equivalent  to  a  phrase  like my  love available  in  their ' n a t i v e ' language. 6 Similar  examples  can  be  found  in  the  lyrics of many other  pop  songs and  even  poetry.  For  example,  a young  woman  would  rarely  say aishite-ru to  a man  that  she  has  become  enamoured  with,  but  may  use  the  English  T  love you'  instead.  Elsewhere  I  have  made  the  argument  that  differences  in  the representational  and  symbolic  content  of native Japanese  terms  compared  with their  English  equivalents  account  for  the  presence  of English  in  daily  speech, as well  as  a  range  of  other  discourses  (Stanlaw,  1992b).

On  this  page  and  the  next  two pages,  I present  three  versions  of  the  song. Figure  5.3  (p.  108)  shows  the  'original'  lyrics  that  are  included  in Wink's compact  disc.  Figure  5.2  (p.  107)  presents  a  romanized  version,  and  Figure 5.1  (below)  a  full  English  translation  (my  own).

English  in  the  lyrics of Japanese  pop  songs  also serves a number  of  creative poetic  functions.  For  instance,  in  Yuming's  song Sand  Castles she  punctuates her  choruses with  the  English  locutions somebody to kiss, somebody to hug, somebody to love (see Figure  5.4,  p.  110). The  repeated  phrases  always follow  a line  ending with  the  sentence-final  marker ne, seeking  the  agreement  of  her  listener/lover before  expressing  her  emotional  and  physical  desires.  Such  emotions  might not  achieve  expression  in  'pure'  Japanese  with  such  apparent  ease.  One i n f o r m a n t (a  woman  in  her  mid-thirties  from  the  Tokyo  area)  expressed her feelings  about  this  song,  and  the  use  of  English  in  the  lyrics,  thus:

[T]he  story in  the  song  is very old:  'Oh,  we couldn't  get  together,  we  were almost  getting  married,  but  we broke  up, we  thought  we were  the  perfect match'  and  so  on.  This  always  happens.  This  is  a very  common  story  for everyone. But by using  these  kinds of loanwords, it is not  so just  a  repetition of  an  old  story;  this  is the  singer's  own  personal  new fresh  experience.  Do you  understand?  That  kind  of feeling  is created  here.  Consider sand castle. The word castle is already  Japanese  now. Even children  know the word.  T want to be  the  king in  the castle.' There  are  many English words like  that  here  in this  song,  that  are  ours  [Japanese]  now: nylon coat, or goal-in suru ['to  do  a goal-in',  or  'to  achieve  the  goal  of getting  married']. Here goal-in is like  it is for Americans, to get married.  [. . .] These new English sentences, like somebody to kiss, somebody to hug, somebody to love, is a way of personalizing  things.  This makes it special because the story itself is very traditional. On  the other  hand, by putting  in  these  kinds  of loanwords,  I am  getting  the  feeling  of  seeing  a new fresh  individual  experience.  By using  these  kinds  of  loanwords,  these kinds  of  things  come  flashing  by. I really should  say that we don't  really  use the  word sand castle, however.  To me, sand castle is a word we can  figure  out. We usually use  the Japanese  word suna  no shiro [&amp;p(D$i] of  course.  But  this [English loanword]  is kind of vague, a little different.  To us, it carries a  feeling like something from  a  'fragile  dream' [hakanai yume, l i ^ O * ]. Isn't  it?  It is that  love is very temporary,  or  like in  a dream; it is not  real. It is gone  with the wind  or waves.

This  female  informant  thus  argues  that  the  use  of  English  in  the  lyrics  gives new life  and  a new emodonal  personalization  to a  traditional  and  cliched  story. The  'fragile'  and  'dreamlike'  images  evoked  by  the  English  word  castle  help create  a  kind  of  'fairy-tale'  reality,  reflecting  the fleeting, transitory  nature  of romantic  love. The  use  of  English  for  such  'exotic'  and  'exoticizing'  purposes can  also  be  seen  in  the  songs  of  Matsutooya  Yumi,  whose  latest  CD  albums bear  such  unusual  titles as Frozen Roses, Delight Slight  Light  Kiss,  Alarm  a la  Mode, Tears and  Reasons,  Cowgirl Dreamin, and Wave of the  Zuvuya.

Somebody to kiss, Somebody to hug, Somebody to love

English words may also be contributing  to the creation  of 'new  structural forms'  in  pop  music  lyrics. Yuming's  song, Dawn Purple, from  her  album  of the  same  name,  provides  a  good  illustration  of  this  (see  Figures  5.7-5.9, pp.  114-6). This  song  is about  separation  and  parting,  as a woman  appears to be sending her  lover off on  a long journey  to an unknown  destination.  It is dawn, and  she knows that they must part. In  the song, she asks him  to  return, claiming that her tears are a pendant, a proof of everlasting love. In Dawn Purple, English  loanwords  are  only  twice  inserted  in  the  form  of  individual  lexical items,  in  reference  to  'an  open door and  a  special 'pendant'. Instead,  whole independent  English  phrases  and  lines are  incorporated  into  the  song, as in:

Close to me motto chikaku kanjiru  no anata  no koto Where to be nagai tabi-e okuri-dasu yoake dakara Fly away mezameta toki watashi ga moo mienakute mo One fine day shimpai sezu tabidatsu no yo doa-o akete

Not only does Yuming insert English lines, but these lines also carry a rhyming structure,  which  is usually  absent  from Japanese  verse. In  the  refrain  of  the song, four  phrases  are  repeated  several  times:

Close to me machi-tsuzukeru

Close to me mata au hi-o

Close to memachi-tsuzukeru

Close to me mata au hi-o

Here, each  phrase  is equally divided,  in  terms of length  of utterance,  into  an English  antecedent (Close to me) and  a Japanese  response. Interestingly,  each Japanese  part  of  the  phrase  begins with  a masyllable  ( machir or mata-), thus alliterating  with  the  final  word  in  the  English  phrase (me), complementing the  ending  of  the  English  part  of  the  phrase. Although  traditional Japanese poetry  sometimes  uses  alliteration  and  assonance  as  a  technique of versification,  it  does  so  in  rather  different  ways from  that  illustrated  here (Brower,  1972). While  there  is little  in  the  way of  rhyme  in Japanese  poetry, English  loanwords  and  phrases  seem  to  allow  the  introduction  of  such schemes, thus creating  new structural  possibilities  and  new  forms.

The  term  'relexification' in  linguistics  is  generally  used  to  refer to situations where vocabulary items in one  language become  replaced  by terms from  another  language  especially  during  extensive  language  contact.  In  the domain  of colour,  for  example,  certain  basic Japanese  colour  terms  such  as pink (momo), orange (daidai), purple (murasaki), and grey (nezumi-iro) appear

to  be  in  the  process  of  being  replaced  by English  loanwords.  One  example  of colour  relexification  can  be  found  in  the  song just  discussed,  Yuming's Dawn Purple. The  title  is  given  in  complete  English,  that  is, in  roman  letters,  while in  the  text  of  the  song,  reference  is made  to  the  dawn's murasaki  no sora (purple sky),  in Japanese.  While  these  two  items  are  not  always interchangeable,  there is  little  d o u b t  t h a t  ' p u r p l e '  has  now  become  an  additional  vocabulary  item available  to Japanese  speakers  (see  Chapter  9). When  'purple-ish'  hues  need to  be  named, Japanese  has  at  least  sets  of  two  terms  at  its disposal,  and  English again  provides  additional  linguistic  resources  for  the Japanese  language  system.

Running  parallel  to  linguistic  relexification,  one  may  also  consider  what I  choose  to  call  the  process  of  're-exoticization'  that  may  occur  in  this  context. Not  all  English l o a n w o r d s r e p l a c e native  J a p a n e s e counterparts, and relexification in  its  classic  sense  is  probably  rare.  In  many  cases,  English loanwords  may be  used  for  their  own  qualities,  but  in  other  contexts  their  use appears  to  be  designed  to  attract  attention  to  the  corresponding ' n a t i v e ' Japanese  lexical  item  and  to  relocate  the Japanese  term  from  the  realm  of t h e  m u n d a n e  to  the  exotic,  so  that  it  is  thus ' r e-exoticized'. 7

One  song  that  demonstrates  this  process,  I  suggest,  is Yuming's Sandokyassuru (Sand Castles) (see  Figures  5.4-5.7).  This  song  describes  a  woman's coming  to  grips  with  a  long,  deteriorating,  love  affair.  She  walks  alone  along t h e  beach,  and  she  pauses  to  make  a  small  castle  in  the  sand.  The  tide  comes in,  and  the  castle  soon  crumbles.  She  sings  that  her  relationship  is  like  this crumbling  castle,  and  she  regrets  she  and  her  lover  will  never  be  the  ideal couple  everyone  thought  they would  be.  Everyone  had  expected  them  to  get married  and  make  a  good  marriage,  but  they  had  been just  like  a prince  And a princess blindly  living  in  a sand  castle. Throughout  the  song,  one  may  observe how  the  use  of  English  words  serves  to  heighten  the  force  of  native  Japanese t e r ms.  For  example, Sando-kyassuru is  used  in  the  title,  and kyassuru once  in t h e  second  line,  written  in katakana. But  in  the  climax  of  the  song's  message in  the  fourth  stanza,  the  native Japanese  term (suna no  o-shiro) is used,  so  that t h e  last  three  lines  of  the  stanza  read: suna no  o-shiro ni  sundeta/ purinsesu to purinsu ne /  somebody to kiss, somebody to hug,  somebody to love ( 'We  lived  in  a  sand castle  [just  like]  /  a  princess  and  prince,  don't  you  think?  /  Somebody  to  kiss, somebody  to  hug,  somebody  to  love').  The  switching  in  and  out  of  English words  helps  to  create  a  'cognitive  dissonance'  in  the  minds  of  listeners.  The exotic  English  word sando-kyassuru becomes  'familiar'  through  its  use  in  the title,  a n d  t he  occurrence  of kyassuru in  the  first  stanza,  but  halfway t h r o u g h t h e  song  the  switch  is  made  to  the suna no  o-shiro ' e x o t i c '  familiar  of  native Japanese.  Which  takes  place,  tellingly,  at just  that  part  in  the  song,  where  the woman  is singing  of  the  'sand  castle'  they  shared  together.  The  exoticness  of t h e  J a p a n e s e  here  is  further  highlighted  by  the  shift  back  to  English  in t h e next  line  ('We  were  a princess a n d prince, weren't  we').  There  are  several  other examples  in  this  song  where  English  words  are juxtaposed  or  contrasted  with Japanese  items,  e.g. nylon  coat+  suso ( ' h e m ' ) ; shiroi ('white')  + lace; or arches + nagarete ['flowing'].  In  each  case,  the  native Japanese  term  seems  to  take  on more  force  when juxtaposed  with  the  English  loanword.

English  may  also  play  a  cultural  and  linguistic  role  in  expressing  aspects of  modern Japanese  consumer  culture  in  a society often  characterized  as  both ' c o n s u m e r i s t '  and  'materialistic'. 8 I n d e e d ,  in  discussions  of  consumerism  in Japan,  the  accusation  is  often  made  that  consumerism  is  a  Western i mport, which,  like  English  words, has  contributed  to  the  pollution  of Japanese  society. Whether  such  claims  are justified  is debatable,  but  the  issues  of  consumerism

and  materialism  regularly find  expression  in Japanese  pop  music. One  example of  this  can  be  found  in  the  song Daiamondo ('Diamonds')  from  the  female band Princess  Princess. The  song Diamonds is  a  meditation  on  life,  love,  and maturity,  even  though  the  band  members  were just  barely  into  their  twenties when  they  recorded  it.  In  the  song,  a  young  woman  tells  of  adolescence,  her love  for  music,  and  her  yearning  for  life.  The  conclusion  she  reaches  is  that her  love  of  making  music  is  so  strong  that  she  will  surrender  it  neither for love  nor money  / koin nanka  ja  urenai  /  ai-o kurete  mo agenai/ ('You  can't  sell this  for  any coin/ 1 won't  give  it  to  you  even  though  you  give  me  love').

The  major  symbol  in  the  song,  of  course,  is  that  of  diamonds,  which  is used  in  two  contrasting  ways.  The  girl's  past  memories  are  'treasures'  and ' d i a m o n d s '  from  ' t h e  i n n o c e n t  age  of  my  childhood',  but  today  she's  innocent no  more  and  is  'born  to  be  greedy' (yokubari na  no  wa  umare-tsuki) , ' h o o k e d on  having  a  good  time' (tanoshimu koto  ni  kugi-zuke), and  is  now  used  to  a different  kind  of  present (purezento). At  the  end  of  the  song,  she  sings  that what  moves  her  now  are diamonds (watashi-o ugokasu no  wa daiamondo), the indication  is  that  she  is  referring  to  the  cut  and  polished  variety.  O n e  thirtyyear-old  female  informant  from  Tokyo  commented  that  for  her  the  song evoked  the  lives  of  female  pop  stars:

I don't  understand  all the  English  here  but  it is clear  that some young girl is singing some love story. She is a diamond. She is a kawai-ko-chan ['cute  young child'].  I don't  feel  this  song very deeply  . . . these  words skyscraper,  handle, brown [the  cathode-ray  tube  in  a television  set], diamonds, kiss -  and  getting good  at  kissing  . . . they're  OK.  But what  about propeller mawashi ['turn  the propeller']? What is that, really? It is nonsense, nonsense, nonsense! But when a kawai-ko-chan [cute  teenage  girl]  comes  up  and  sings these  kinds  of  songs, in  this kind  of way . . . putting  in these loanwords  . . .  we get a certain  feeling. That is, this song is just  a creation  of some  kind  of atmosphere, a creation  of some  kind  of image. So I don't  feel  anything  especially profound  about  it.

Another  Kanto  woman  in  her  thirties  said  around  the  same  time  that  she focused  on  the  relationships  described  in  the  song  and  their  implications:

I feel  like she  is talking  about  living in  a small Tokyo apartment,  maybe with a boyfriend  or someone. Nothing more I feel. Even though I don't  understand the  loanwords, I feel  like  I am  in  a kissaten [Japanese  coffee  shop],  probably because I don't listen to the words much, but  just hear it as background  music.

Consumer  materialism  is also reflected  at several  other  places in  the  song,  often encoded  in  English  loanwords,  as when  the  girl  marvels  at skyscrapers, sings  of flying  a r o u n d t h e  city  on  golden handles, after  tightening  up  her belt, and t u r n i n g t h e propeller. Finally,  a  male Japanese  colleague  of  mine  provided  a third  perspective  on  the  song,  commenting  that:

This  song  feels sooo J a pan.  This  type  of  music  is really Japan.  Hearing  this reminded  me of life in Japan.  It doesn't matter  if I understand  the  loanwords in  it  or  not.  It sounds Japanese!  It is that  beat;  that  kind  of voice. I feel  like I am  in Japan,  in  a  small  tiny  apartment  in  a danchi [a Japanese  housing project]. A small place. Tomorrow I am getting on  the train  to ride one  hour to go to work. That structured  society, and  this song  this young girl's  singing really  reminds  of  that.  I  didn't  pay  attention  to  the  words  much;  I  didn't understand  much  of anything  in  the  song, but,  then,  I didn't  need  to.

Finally,  we  might  also  consider  how  the  use  of  English  words  is  used  to express  images  of  domestic  life  in Japan.  Not  only  can  English  words  in  pop songs  be  used  to  depict  the  habits  and  eccentricities  of  a  modern  consumer culture,  but  they  can  also  be  used  to  exemplify  less  unfamiliar  scenes,  such  as domestic  encounters  and  other  everyday  occurrences.  Examples  of  this  occur in  a  n u m b e r  of  songs  that we  have  already  mentioned,  including Yuming's Sand Castles, with  the  singer  mentioning  that  her nylon  coat is  flapping  in  the  wind, perhaps  mimicking  the  sound  of  her  tears.  English  loanwords  can  also  be involved  in  the  creation  of new metonyms.  For  example,  in  the  song Diamonds, t he  female  voice  asserts  that  some  things  cannot  be  bought  for  either  love  or money,  and  here  the  English  word coin is  u s e d  in  the  phrase koin nanka ja urenai (literally,  some  things  can't  be  sold  for coins).

## English  words  in Japanese  poetry

In  addition  to  their  uses  in  pop  music,  English  words  are  also  finding  a  place in  modern Japanese  literature,  notably in  the writing of poets  such  as the tanka poet  Tawara  Machi.  Tawara  is particularly  adept  at  creating  domestic  images in  interesting  ways  through  the  use  of  English  words.  For  example,  in t h e following  poem  she  uses  several  loanwords  to  help  promote  the  ambience  of a  secure  relationship  and  mellow  domestisticity. 9

doyoobi wa zukku-o haite ai-ni kuru sarariiman  to wa

That salaryman who comes to visit  me on  Saturdays, wearing his sneakers, is sure  a strange  animal.

michi no ikimono

In  another  poem,  she  evokes  the  world  of  the  office  lady  who  window-shops on  her  way  to  work:

## mZtztf r ^ B P g t J j (D/i-&lt;f&gt;ZLXl\ZJ£(Difc\,\y^5X

tooru tabi

Each  time

'honjitsu  kagiri ' no

I  pass  by

baagen  o

I  see  the  red blouse

shite  iru  mise  no

of  the  store

akai  burausu

that  is  having  a  'today  only' sale

The  use  of  English  words  can  be  a  powerful  tool  in  the  construction  of  new analogies,  metaphors,  metonyms,  in Japanese  verbal  art  of  all  kinds  (Stanlaw, 2000a).  One  interesting  metaphor  is found  in  Tawara  Machi's  poem  about  a woman  deciding  to  leave  her  lover:

hanbaagaa shoppu no  seki-o tachi  agaru yoo-ni  otoko-o suteteshimaoo

Like jumping  out of your  seat at  a hamburger  jointl That's  how I'll  leave this  guy.

Tawara's  imagery  here  is  concrete,  effective,  and  humorous.  As  deliberately as  leaving  McDonald's  after  having  a Biggu  Makku for  lunch,  the  woman  will simply  get  up  and  leave  her  man.  The  comparison  between  departing  a  fastfood  restaurant,  and  ending  a  bad  relationship  is amusingly  economical.

In  addition  to  their  metaphorical  uses, English  words  also  have  a  potential for  the  kinds  of  ambiguities  and  indeterminacies  exploited  by  poets  in  their craft  (Leech,  1969).  English  loanwords  can  simultaneously  be  both  more  and less  symbolically  meaningful  than  their  native Japanese  counterparts.  Even  if no Japanese  equivalents  exist,  the  inclusion  of  English  loanwords  can  be  used for  a  variety  of  purposes,  and often t h e  multiplicity  of  reference a n d connotation  makes  English  words  particularly  effective  in  poetry  and  song.  We have  seen  this  many  times  in  the  above  examples.

English  loanwords  can  sometimes  be  used  ambiguously  in  even  other  ways. For  instance,  consider  this  poem  by Tawara  Machi:

## Sfe/fclcetfUltoU  TZL-X + &gt;Aj ( f c U 5 £ &lt; D A &gt; K £ ' J - A

nesshin ni haha ga susumeshi yuu sukin A to iu  na  no hando-kuriimu

Earnestly

recommended  by my  mother:

the hand cream

named

' Youth Skin A.'

A young woman  drops by to see her  mother.  What  she  remembers  most  about the  occasion  was that  her  mother  enthusiastically suggests  that  she  use  a  special c r e a m t o  keep her h a n d s l o o k i n g  young.  The i m p l i c a t i o n of t h i s r e c o m m e n d a t i o n of  course  is  that  the  girl's  age  is  beginning  to  show.  One i n t e r e s t i n g  aspect  here  is  the  name  of  the Yuu  sukin A. There  is  ambiguity here  about  how  these  Japanese  English  words  should  be  understood or ' t r a n s l a t e d '  i n t o  a  more  standard  form  of  English,  or  into Japanese.  Is  this 'You  skin  A',  'Youth  skin  A',  or  even  'Your  skin  A'?  A  number  of  readings  are possible:  'Youth'  in Japanese (yuusu) combines  with  'Skin' (sukin) to  become yuusukin. Yuu may  be  read  both  as  'you'  and  'your'  (although  'your'  is  often rendered  as  'yua'),  and  it  is difficult  to  totally  discount  any  of  these.  Nor  need we  do  so,  as any or  a//of  these  meanings  are  indeed  made  possible  in  poetic expression.

Finally,  it  is also  worth  noting  that  there  is an  important  visual  dimension in  the  use  of  English  words  in Japanese  poetry,  as  these  are  often  used for visual  and  graphic  effect.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the Japanese  and Chinese writing  systems, Japanese  and  Chinese  verse  have  always carried  a visual  aspect that  is  lacking  in  the  poetry  of  many  other  cultures.  Since  the  earliest  poems and  songs from  the Manyoo-shuu 1,200  years ago, Chinese  characters  have  been used  by Japanese  poets  for  a  variety  of  illustrative  ends,  both  playful and serious.  The  use  of  English  words  thus  contributes  another  linguistic  resource which  may  be  used  for  graphic  and  pictorial  effects.  One  example  of  this  is seen  in  the  following  Tawara  Machi tanka poem:

## W(tT«&gt;&lt;T0KI0(Z)B(DIfi»«lCTIIiUL-*fi3-5

akete yuku

Dawn  breaks over Tokyo. At a  corner vending  machine we buy two cans of cola.

TOKIO no sumi no hanbaiki nite aganai shi ni-hon no koora

Graphically,  two  items  vividly stand  out  when  first  viewing  this  poem.  First,  we notice  that  the  name  of  the Japanese  capital  is written  in  capital  roman  letters: TOKIO. Not  only is the  name  given  in  roman  letters, but  the  spelling  is  according to  the  archaic  norm  of  the  nineteenth  century.  Another  oddity  is how  the  use of  romanization  actually  violates  the  structure  of  the  poem.  As  it  stands  now, the  second  line  of  this tanka has  only  six syllables, where  seven  would  normally be  required. As it is spelled  here  in  roman  letters, TOKIO uses only three  syllables (to-ki-o). If normal Japanese  orthography were  to be  used,  'Tokyo' would  come out  with  an  extra  syllable  (to-o-kyo-o)  and  the  offending  line  would  be  fine. The  second  thing  to  notice  is that  the  poem  ends  with  a loanword  in katakana, ' c o l a ' .  This  poem  is  certainly  eye-catching,  for  the just  discussed,  but t h e graphic  organization  of the  poem  also seems  to contribute  to its meaning.  One possible  reading  here  is  that  the  couple  in  question  are  not  ' m o d e r n ' or ' s ophisticated'  yuppie  types, but  a  rather  old-fashioned  couple  who  have  been somewhat  chastely  out  for  a  stroll.  But  that  is a  very  personal  reading,  largely evoked  by  the  archaism  of  TOKIO.  Many  alternative  readings  are  also  possible, of  course,  particularly,  given  the  cryptic  form  of  the tanka poem.

The  visual  dimension  of  the  graphic  representation  of  English  words  may also  be  seen  in J-pop s ong  titles  and  lyrics  as  well  as  the  names  of  singers  and bands  (Stanlaw,  1990b;  2000b). 10 Almost  every  song  examined  here i n d e e d uses (i)  English  song  titles  (e.g., Boys  Don't Cry); (ii)  English r o m a n i z e d loanwords  (e.g., Dawn  Purple), and  (iii)  English katakana loanwords  (e.g., Sando kyassuru) in  their  printed  lyrics. The  names  of  singers  (e.g., Yuming) and  rock groups  (e.g., Wink,  Princess  Princess) also  use  English  and romaa-ji extensively. The  collection  of  Tawara  Machi's  contemporary tanka poems, 'Sarada kinenbi

(Salad  Memorial  Day) uses  the  word  'salad'  in  its  title.  Both  her  name  and t h e title  of  the  book  are  transliterated  (but,  oddly,  not  translated)  in  bright  pink r o man  letters  on  the  cover  of  her  book.  One  area  worthy  of  further research and  analysis  is the  graphic  way in  which  the  written  representations  of  English words  in Japanese  pop  song  lyrics  are  guided  by  a visual  linguistic  logic  that complements  the  verbal  aspects  of  songs.  English  words  and  phrases,  as  well as r o m a n l e t t e r s , can c o m b i n e t o create a r a n g e of  visual effects. Characteristically, Japanese  music  fans  pay  particular  attention  to  the  words of  the  songs  they  hear.  On  television  variety  shows,  the  name  of  the  group and  the  lyrics  of  the  songs  are  displayed  in  caption  form  as  the  song  is  played. When,  for  example,  the  roller-skating  rock  and  roll  group  'TT; GENJI'  sing  on television  about  their West Side  Story lifestyles  and James  Dean-like  rebellions, the  scene  comes  alive with  the  bustle  of  competing  and  complementary  scripts -  native Japanese kanji,  katakana loanwords,  and romaa-ji English  phrases  all jostle  with  each  other  for  a  place  on  the  screen.

## Summary

This  chapter  began  with  an  exploration  of the  use  of English  words  in Japanese pop  songs,  and  then  raised  the  question  why  such  words  and  phrases  have gained  such  a wide  currency  in  this context.  One  very commonly-held  response to  this  query  is  that  the  majority  of  such  words  have  been ' i m p o r t e d ' i n t o Japan,  through  processes  of  lexical  borrowing  than  operate  parallel  to  the i mportation  of  the  Western  pop  music.  An  alternative  view  to  this  simplistic explanation  is  presented  through  a  discussion  of  'motivations'  for  English words  in Japanese  pop  music, which  involves a consideration  such  interrelated factors  as  the  use  of  English  for  audacious,  symbolic,  'poetic'  and ' e x o t i c ' purposes,  the  creation  of  new  structural  forms,  as  a  means  of  relexifying  and re-exoticizing  the Japanese  language,  the  expression  of  modern  Japanese consumer  culture;  and  the  expression  of  images  of  domestic  life.  In  addition, t he  use  of  English  in  contemporary Japanese  poetry  was  also  discussed.  The consideration  of  detailed  examples  of  actual  texts  reveals  a  much greater degree  of  complexity  than  the  narrowly  one-dimensional  view  of  linguistic contact  that  relies  on  a  reductive  'loanwords'  approach  to  this  issue.

The  loanwords  approach  is flawed  for  at  least  two  broad  reasons.  First,  a majority  of  English  words  in  current  use  are  not  imported,  but  created  in Japan,  and,  second,  such Japanese  English  words  are  designed  for  Japanese, not  Western,  purposes  (Stanlaw,  1991).  Most  'English'  terms  in  common  use in  J a p a n are  invented  or  at  least  modified in  order  to  comply  with t h e communicative  norms  of Japanese  society  as well  as for  the  range  of  purposes for  which  they  are  required.  Thus Japanese  English  words  serve different purposes  in  different  circumstances  and  situations;  they  have  intrinsic  value

and  use. In  the contexts of versification,  we have seen  that English words serve a  number  of  different  poetic  functions  and  it  is possible  that  the  increased use of English  words will in future  radically alter  the  face  of Japanese  poetry, providing even  this high  cultural  form  with  new alternatives  and  possibilities. English  loanwords today may offer  a new vernacular for tanka and haiku poets, as well  as novelists,  and  playwrights,  and  songwriters. The  confluence  of  the Japanese  and  Chinese  languages fifteen  hundred  years ago altered Japanese in  many ways, both  structurally  and  semantically,  but  despite  this  influence, Japanese  retained  its  essential  character.  It  incorporated  these  imported Chinese  features  assiduously,  but  nativized  these  into  the Japanese  language system.

Similar  sociolinguistic  processes  are  currently  at  work  regarding  the current  influx  of English  words  into Japanese,  and  this is reflected  in  a wide range  of language  contexts. In  Chapter  6, I shall  extend  this investigation  to consider Japanese-English  language  contact  and  the  issue of  gender.

## A  new  voice:  The  use  of English as  a new rhetoric in  modern  Japanese women's language

## Introduction

In  this  chapter 1 I will  extend  the  discussion  that  began  in  the  last  chapter.  I will examine  the  innovative  uses of English  by Japanese  women,  especially  in the  creative  arts. A millennium  ago, Japanese  women  were  deprived  of  the social  and  cultural  advantages  of using imported  Chinese  linguistic  resources (such  as writing,  or  the  political  or  economic  vocabulary).  Ironically  today, however - at least in certain areas of artistic expression  such as music, poetry, or  fashion  -Japanese  women  seem  to  dominate  the  extensive  current importation  of English.  In  this chapter,  I will argue  that  the judicious  use  of English  and  English  loanwords  gives Japanese  women  new rhetorical  power and  discourse  choices  unknown  to them  previously.

It  is  clear  by  now  that  English  loanwords  in Japanese  abound,  and  have been  commonly  used  in  modern Japanese  for  over a century. As I have  said in  earlier  chapters,  no Japanese  person  today  could  carry  on  even  the  most elementary  of  conversations  without  using  them;  they  exist  in  a variety  of registers  and  domains,  and  are  found  everywhere  from  radio  and  television advertisements  to official  government  documents.  However,  as we have  seen in  Chapter  5,  English  loanwords  and  phrasings  have  proliferated  in  the linguistics  of popular  music, especially  in  songs written  by women.  I  suggest that  this  is not  coincidental.  It is likely  that Japanese  women  songwriters  are using  English  to  avoid  some  of  the  linguistic  restrictions  placed  upon  them by the Japanese language. For example, many female Japanese songwriters use English  extensively for  humorous  puns  and jokes,  and  unusual  musical  and lyrical  effects.  Similar  techniques  have  also been  used  by the  neo-traditional poet  Tawara  Machi, whose verse  captured  the  hearts  of millions  of Japanese women  in  a  national  fad  a  few  years  ago. Advertising  and  magazines  that primarily aim  at women  almost always use English  extensively.

I believe  that  this use  of English  and  English  loanwords  is a technique  to assist in  the  expression  of a new feminine  voice. In  medieval Japan,  men  and

women  in  many ways led  quite  distinctive  and  separate  linguistic  lives.  Men - the literate and  literary half of the population - wrote publicly, in a largely imported  idiom  of  Chinese  and  Sino-Japanese  characters  (the  medium  of religion,  government,  and  classical  literature). Women,  on  the  other  hand, did  not  learn  Chinese; nor  did  they learn  the  Chinese  characters  and  writing system. Women  generally  wrote  private  thoughts  in  an  indigenous,  that  is, Japanese, vocabulary. The  result of this separation  was the  creation  of several marvellous  literary forms  which were  unique  in world  literature  at  that  time. However,  in  spite  of  all  this  artistic  creativity,  it was not  until  modern  times that women  became generally fluent  in the standard  literary and  poetic  styles commonly used  by men  for  hundreds  of years.

It  is well  known  that  there  is still  a marked  linguistic  sexual  dimorphism in Japan  (cf.  Shibamoto,  1985, 1987). There  are  certain  modes  of  linguistic expression  in Japanese  that are extremely difficult  for women  to use. English, however,  offers  new  opportunities  for  poetic  representations,  individual creativity,  and  emotional  expression.  There  are  also  new  alternatives  and potentials.  The  use  of  English  loanwords  helps  circumvent  some  of  these sociolinguistic  restrictions,  giving Japanese  women  another  voice  and,  a different  symbolic vocabulary, in which  to express their thoughts and  feelings.

In  the  following  section,  I will  briefly  review  the  development  of  the Japanese  writing system  that  has been  discussed  in Chapter  4. I will also show how script  and  circumstance  have  combined  to give women  a new means  to express their emotions and desires. I will then present examples of how similar phenomenon  is occurring  today with  a  new  'imported'  idiom  'English'  in popular  song and  poetry. I will then  conclude with speculations on  the  future prospects for  women  in Japan,  both  linguistic  and  social.

## The  origins  of  the Japanese  writing  system  and  the  first  women's voice

The  origins of the Japanese  people  are clouded  in myth, mystery, and  politics. According  to legend  and  the  official  'historical'  chronicles, First Brother  and First  Sister,  Izanami  and  Izanagi,  started  the  line  that  gave  the Japanese  the original  Sun  Goddess  - Amaterasu-oo-mikami,  the  direct  ancestor  of  the Imperial family  (including the current emperor). Archaeologically, it is safe  to say that certainly by the fourth  century A D those who would become the ancestors of  today's  modern  population  were  in  place. The  so-called Yamato  court  (AD 300-700)  formed  the  basis of  the  later Japanese  historical  state, when  in  the 710s and  720s the  first  of  the  famous  historical  chronicles  began  to  appear. Although  the agricultural Yamato people appeared  to have had  a very complex system  of government  and  ritual,  they had  no written  language  until  political and  religious contact began with the  Chinese, perhaps as early as AD 400.

The  Chinese  writing  system was probably  introduced  into Japan  around 594, when Buddhism was declared  to be the official  religion  (Mizukami, 1998, Tetsuji,  1989). At first,  the Japanese  did  not write their own language, but  used ' pure  Chinese'  to  record  matters  of  state  and  consequence.  But  to  say  that one  single  'Chinese'  language  was brought  in  to  the  islands is somewhat  of a misnomer.  On  the  coast  of  the  East  Asian  mainland,  there  are  dozens  of different  Sinitic  languages  even  today,  and  unsurprisingly  speakers  of  every one at some time or other  reached Japan. This plethora of available  'Chinese' languages would  have important  repercussions  for  both  the Japanese  writing system  and  the  future  development  of the Japanese  women's  speech.

One  of  the  reasons  why  the  early Japanese  became  literate  only  in  a Chinese language  rather  than Japanese  is that in most ways written  Chinese is incompatible with spoken Japanese. For one thing, the Chinese languages  are monosyllabic,  tonal, and  largely uninflecting,  making  the  polysyllabic,  atonal, and agglutinative Japanese  language extremely hard  to write using  ideographic Chinese  characters  (called kanji, or  'Chinese  letters',  in  modern  Japanese). While nouns could  rather  easily be borrowed,  the  Chinese writing system  had little  to  offer  in  terms  of  case  markers,  affixes,  indicators  of  tense,  sentencefinal  particles  and  the  like.

In  any  case,  as  discussed  in  Chapter  4  and  the  Appendix,  the  earliest attempt  to write  down Japanese  is found  in  the Manyoo-shuu ('Collection  of Ten Thousand  Leaves'), an  early poetry anthology of some 4,500 poems  (e.g. Levy,  1981).  Since kanji characters  had  to  be  used  to  record  every  sound  of Japanese,  much  of the  time  the  Chinese  characters  were  used  only for  their phonetic  value.  (To  use  a  simple  English  example,  a drawing  of  an  eyeball might  be  used  if I wanted  to write  the  sound  of  T or  'Aye'.)  Thus,  many  of the  poems  in  the Manyoo-shuu were  rebuses, with  characters  being  used  for their sound value in a Chinese language, regardless of their original  meanings. These glyphs became  known  as Manyoo-gana ('Manyoo-shuu script'). At  other times,  Chinese  characters  could  be  borrowed  for  their  meanings  alone  and be  used  to  represent  a native Japanese  word  regardless  of how the  character was pronounced  in  Chinese.  Every poet,  of course,  had  their  own  intention when  choosing  a character,  and  few characters were  consistently  chosen  the same way  (giving centuries  of philologists'  active  careers). The  result  of  this, as  Roy  Andrew  Miller  (1967:  33)  says, was  that  the 'Manyoo-shuu script esteemed  its own complexities as virtues rather  than  . . . defects.'  Even  to  this day, some of these  peculiar  legacies from  Chinese  still linger  in  the Japanese language, both  in  spoken  form  and  the writing system. Almost every Japanese character,  for  example,  has at least two ways of being pronounced,  and  some of  the  most  common  ones  have  upwards  of a dozen  or  more. Japanese  has also been  blessed with a multitude  of Chinese loanwords or words of  Chinese origin,  and  even  today;  these  often  sound  sophisticated,  erudite,  academic, or  educated  -  much  like  Latin  or  Greek  words  in  English.  However,  it  is a

completely  different  matter  in  the  case  of  the Japanese  proto-script, Manyoogana. It  was  almost  as  if  the Japanese  decided  to  create  a  writing  system  that was  as  complex  as possible.  But  again  Miller  reminds  us  that  it is a  mistake  to attempt  to  'impose  our  modern  standards  of  practicality  and  simplicity  upon an  earlier  age  or  an  alien  culture'  (p.  33).

Even  though  the  advent  of Manyoo-gana allowed  pure  Japanese  to  be written,  albeit  in  somewhat  awkward  form,  much  of  the  writing  was  still  done in  Chinese  for  the  following  several  centuries.  I  described  some  of  these processes  in  Chapter  4,  but  I will  now  look  at  the  impact  these  developments had  on Japanese  women.  In  the  ninth  century  during  the  late  Heian  Period (794-1192), however,  two other  forms  of writing were  developed;  both  of  them were  syllabaries  based  on  the Man  yoo-gana phonetic  characters.  In  the  first case,  the katakana ('imperfect'  or  'angular  script),  parts  of  the  characters  were t a k e n  as  abbreviations  for  the  whole  character,  thereby  acting  as  a  kind  of shorthand.  They were  often  used  for  writing  particles  or  inflections,  as well  as sometimes  indicating  the  intended  readings  of  other  Chinese characters themselves.  (These  are  today's katakana that  loanwords  and  foreign  names  are written  in,  which  we  have  discussed  in  the  previous  chapters.)  The  second syllabary,  the hiragana ('smooth,  plain,  simple  script'), was a set of cursive  forms loosely  based  on  the  original Man  'yoo-gana Chinese  characters.

But just  what  are  these  different  scripts  used  for?  Before  this  question  can be  answered,  two issues should  be  noted.  First,  there  was nothing  approaching mass  literacy  in Japan  at  that  time;  it  was  only  the  aristocracy  who  had t h e time  and  inclination  to  master  the  intricacies  of  the  complex Japanese  writing system.  Second,  'Japanese'  discourse  at  that  time  was  largely  diglossic. Impersonal  and  institutional  discourse  was largely written  by men,  using  pure classical  Chinese  or Japanized-Chinese  that  employed  Chinese-based kanji characters (such  as  the  square  versions of  Manyoo-gana). This i n c l u d e d government  documents  and  edicts, historical chronicles, and  formal  and  public discourse  of all  kinds.  Keene  (1993:  486)  uses  the  term  the  'Yamato  language', to  refer  to  the  other  extant  code:  the  native  tongue  of  the  Yamato  people. This  is  the  non-Sinified  Japanese  that  used  words  and  phrases  of  native ('Yamato')  Japanese  origin  before  the  influence  of  Chinese. Written  (Yamato) Japanese  probably  reflected  the  spoken  language  at  the  time  (cf.  Takeuchi, 1999).  The  script  used  for  this  was  mostly  the hiragana syllabary,  and this Yamato Japanese  writing  was  generally  the  domain  of  women.

The hiragana syllabary  was  actually  called onna-de ('woman's  hand') or onna-mojo ('woman's  letters')  at  that  time,  reflecting  the  penchant  of  women for  using  this  orthography.  Actually,  'for  women,  it was  their  only  means  of expressing  themselves  in  writing'  (Habein,  1984:  30).  As  mentioned,  men generally  wrote  in  Chinese  or  square  versions  of Man  yoo-gana, which  was actually  called otoko-de ('man's  hand')  or otoko-moji ('man's  letters').  It was  not t he  case  that  men  were  forbidden  to  use hiragana, or  had  no  knowledge  of  it

(they wrote  numerous  things  to women  to be sure, including poems  and  the like).  It was just  that women  were  generally  excluded  from  studying  Chinese or  Chinese  characters, and  did  not  write  using  Chinese  or  the Man yoo-gana. As Bowring  (1988: 9-10)  claims,  'As one  might  expect, written  Chinese  was jealously guarded  and from  its inception  became  the  exclusive domain  of  the male. Indeed,  in  the public arena  men were under  considerable  pressure  not to  use  Japanese,  to  prove  their  fitness  for  office,  and  ultimately their masculinity,  by their  command  of  Chinese  poetry  and  prose.  . . . There  can be  no  doubt  that  the  acquisition  of Chinese  by women  was seen  as a threat,  a subversive  act  of considerable,  if undefined,  moment.'

Women,  then,  were writing  in  a private  sphere,  using what was in  many ways a private  (or  'non-public')  language.  Having  not  been  taught  Chinese - as learning  the  language  was considered  unladylike  or  'unbecoming'  women  were  effectively  disenfranchised  and  excluded  from  the  public  male power structure. Indeed, a lot of the earliest women's writings, such as poems, letters,  or  diaries,  were  very  personal  affairs.  However,  from  these  writings ironically  emerged  an  important  literary  development  - the  rise  of wa-bun (literally,  'native  indigenous Japanese  writing'), which  used  Japanese-based vocabulary  and Japanese  syntax,  and  was written  in hiragana. Women  were therefore  largely  responsible  for  the  development  of  this  particular  genre, perhaps  the  greatest  contribution  of the  Heian  Period  to Japanese  and  world literature.  Some  of  the  major  masterpieces  of  the Japanese  literary  cannon were  created  at  that  time,  including Makura  no Suoshi ('The  Pillow  Book  of Sei  Shoonagon'), Kageroo Nikki ('Gossamer  Diary'), Murasaki  Shikibu  Nikki ('The  Diary of Lady Murasaki'), and Izumi  Shikibu Nikki ('The  Diary of  Izumi Shikibu').  Many of  these  works are  autobiographical,  and  'must  be  some  of the  earliest  examples  of  the  attempt  by women  living  in  a  male  dominated society  to  define  the  self  in  textual  terms'  (Bowring,  1988:  11).  Table  6.1 summarizes  the  position  that woman  and  language  had  during  this  period.

The greatest contribution  of the genre was undoubtedly Genji Monogatari ('The  Tale  of  Genji')  by Murasaki  Shikibu  (Lady  Murasaki). 2 This  book,  a prose  narrative  and  eight hundred  poems, is said to be the world's first  novel.

It is generally  'considered  to be the supreme masterpiece of  Japanese  literature .  . . and  . . . has affected  the aesthetic and  emotional  life of the entire Japanese people  for  a  millennium'  (Keene,  1993: 477-8);  it  'occupies  the  place  of Shakespeare  in  English'  (p. 508). In  its thousand  pages  lie  the  story of  some seventy  years  of  the  tumultuous  court  adventures  of  Genji  (the  'shining' prince), and  the various women  in his life. It details the  loves and  passions of men  and women, who were sheltered  from  each  other's view by curtains  and screens.  They  would  often  become  infatuated,  in  a literal  semiotic  fashion, through  some  letter,  poem,  or  other  sign, without  having  a glimpse  of  the object  of their affections.  In short,  the  novel could  be considered  to be a kind of grammar  of sexual  relations.

Lady Murasaki herself was precocious and intelligent. She tells in her  diary how she learned  Chinese  by surreptitiously  listening  in  during  her  brother's Chinese  lessons. She  had  become  so proficient  that she  could  prompt  him  if he got stuck. At this her father  (a minor governor in the Fujiwara  ruling  clan) used  to  sigh  and  exclaim,  'If  only you  were  a boy,  how  proud  and  happy  I should  be'  (Waley,  1960: vii). It soon  became  clear  to  her,  however,  that  not only was it bad  for  boys to be  too fond  of books, it was also  devastating  for  a girl, so she soon  learned  to conceal her  linguistic abilities. However,  educated and  talented  women  were  sometimes  sought  after  by noblemen  to  entertain and  instruct  their  wives and  daughters,  and  Lady Murasaki  eventually  found herself  appointed  as a  lady-in-waiting  to  a consort  of  the  Emperor  Ichijoo. Much  of Genji  was probably written  in  this venue.

Men at the court at this time, who were well-versed in the Chinese classics, had  little  use  for  fiction  or  narrative,  considering  even  the  best  examples  as mere  'diversions  for  women'  (Keene,  1993: 481). However,  men  themselves were no doubt aware of the story. Yet, what is important  here  is that in such  a social, cultural,  and  linguistic  environment,  women  necessarily  had  to  resort to Yamato Japanese  to appropriate  it for  their  own ends  and  desires, and  use it as a medium  to express  their own voice. The  daughters  of the  original  Sun Goddess  had  fallen  since  mythological  times; but  ironically  it was  precisely because  of  their  lack  of  power  that  they  became  the  chroniclers  of  Heian Japanese  civilization,  and  caretakers  of  the Yamato  tradition  and  language.

## Women  and  modern Japanese  popular  music

Back in  primordial  times  the  Sun  Goddess Amaterasu,  in  fit  of jealousy  and rage, hid  in  a cave and  thus cast the world in darkness. The  other  minor  gods and  goddesses  coaxed  her  out  by performing  an  erotic  dance  and  singing ribald  songs.  These  are  said  to  form  the  basis  for  traditional Japanese  folk music and court chants  (of which contemporary music is a direct  descendant). Once  again,  Amaterasu's  spell  reaches  into  modern  times.  Although

contemporary Japanese  music  is  multifarious  and  complex,  as  we  have  seen in  the  last  chapter  (see  also  Stanlaw,  1989;  1990a;  1990b),  I will  only  speak  of one  singer  in  one  style  here.  I  believe,  however,  that  much  of  what  follows could  be  applied  to  many  other  current  Japanese  women  musicians and songwriters,  many  of  whom  are  searching  for  a  new  rhetoric  to  express women's  concerns  and  ideas  without  the  constraints  of  the  male-dominated production  system  (Stanlaw,  2000a).

An  example  of this can  be  seen  in  the  following  song,  again  by  Matsutooya Yumi. As we  have  seen  in  Chapter  5, Yuming  -  as  her  fans  call  her  -  is  said to  be  the  voice  of  the  new  generation  of Japanese  young  women  in t h e i r twenties  and  into  their  forties  (Hatakeyama,  1990).  One  of  her  later  ballads from  a  few  years  ago  is Dareka  ga  anata-o  sagashite  iru ('Somebody  Is  Looking For You'),  a  song  with  both  high-tech  melody  and  lyrics.

The  song  is about  some  young Japanese  urban  professional  -  perhaps  a s t o c k b r o k e r or c o m p u t e r e n g i n e e r -  who  is  in  constant electronic communication  with  the  outside  world  from  his  home.  One  night  while  he  is away,  his  girlfriend  sneaks  into  his  apartment  using  her  extra  key.  She  finds t h e  state  of  his  place  typical  of  many  bachelor's  quarters,  with  clothes  and pajamas lying  on  the  floor  and  unfinished beer on  the  table.  However,  she  also sees  that  his  apartment  is  a  whirlwind  of  electronic  activity. A  fax machine  is buzzing,  the answering machine is  taking  messages,  and  a computer is r u n n i n g with  its monitor glowing  in  the  dark.  The  English  names  of  all  these  gadgets create  a  mood  of  modernity  and  electronic  wizardry  in  the  song.

The use of  English l o a n w o r d s , however,  also  creates a  mood of apprehension  and  intangible  fear.  There  are  unseen  dangers  all  around.  She finds  that  someone  is electronically accessing him, and  this  makes  her  nervous: a code number is  r e p e a t i n g  over  a n d  over.  H e  is being edited. There  is a ghost in t he program. She  fears  that  he  is  trapped  in  an  endless loop of  programs  and fibre optics.  A virus is  present,  and  it  must  be  destroyed:

Dareka ga anata-o editto-shite iru puroguramu  ni goosuto ga iru wa faibaa  no meikyuu de ruupu  kara derarenai

Somebody is editing you There  is a ghost in  the program you are  in  the  labyrinth of fibre and unable  to escape  from  the loop

She  tries  to  save  him,  and  again,  her  salvation  is  presented  to  us  in t h e form  of  English  loanwords.  She  uses  a mouse to input her  own code i nto t h e system.  She  attacks  the virus with  a laser, destroying  the  threat  that  germinates within:

mausu o tataite watashi no koodo-o inputto-shitara anata  ni  matowaru koi no uirusu  ni

reezaa o abiseru

I click  the mouse and and  I input my code, while upon  the  love virus that  is  hanging around  you I will beam  the laser

Structurally,  almost  every  line  of  the  song  ends  in  an  English l oanword (or,  occasionally,  an  English  loanword  with  a verbalizing  suffix  attached).  This is  i n t e r e s t i n g  considering  that Japanese  is  a  verb-final  language.  A  'pure' English  refrain  punctuates  the  choruses  and  the  end  of  the  song:

OPEN YOUR FILE OPEN  YOUR  MIND Don't hide, There is a ghost! I can still be in time, There is a ghost!

(somebody is looking  for you)

(somebody is targeting you)

She warns,  'There  is a ghost,'  but  tells him  not  to  hide,  as she  still can  be  there in  time  to  help  him.  In  the  background  a voice  sings  in Japanese, ' S o meone is looking  for  you  . . . someone  is targeting  you.'  Making  an  equation  between t h e  English  words  'file'  and  'mind'  allows Yuming  to  make  a joke  using  the metonymic  pun  of  an  open  mind  and  an  open  computer  file.

One  informant,  a woman  in  her  late  thirties,  described  the  unique  feeling that  this  song  conveys,  even  if  it  is  not  a  particularly  'catchy'  tune:

This song is very very interesting,  even  though  I might  say I am  not  sure  if I especially like it. To me, this song creates a special 'space', a modern  computercreated  type  of space. It  is  not  really  a  virtual  reality  type  of  thing,  but something  spooky and  mysterious,  like in  a movie. You can  almost  hear  the sound  effects.  The  main  character  who  is  singing  to  me  seems  to  be  an intelligent  professional  management  woman  . . . neither  too young  nor  too old. That  is the  type of person  who is singing  this love song; that  is the  kind of  feeling  that  is created  through  the  selection  of  these  loanwords.  Maybe  I don't  understand  lots  of  things  when  I  hear  it  the  first  time,  but  I  can understand  a lot of it.  . . like computer,  mouse,  monitor ... we use those in  our daily lives all the  time, so that is nothing new. Word processor is another  familiar term. So I can  tell this is about  automation  or computers. The woman must be a career woman and be smart to know how to run  all this kind of  equipment, and  know all these words like fibre, laser, and  so on. She  is also probably well off.  She  is not  necessarily  rich,  but  is independent  and  self-supporting.  She is not  too  old,  of course, because  she  is using  all  these  things. But she  is  not too young, either, as she must be in some kind of management  position.  That is  the  feeling  the  song  gives me.

The  girl  is afraid  the  man  is having  an  affair?  Hmm,  Maybe. But  I think  in the song here his mind is a computer, or  maybe better,  his mind  is a file. She is saying if she can  control  his file she can  control  his mind.  She wants to  open his file so she  can  open  his  mind.  She wants  to  open  it. That  was she  has  a code-number, the  answering  machine  is talking  . . . T want  to  know,  I want  to know everything'. If I just click it, I can  do  it. And  then  I can  delete  that virus - those  other  desires, wills - from  his mind, from  his file. That's  why  she says koi no uirusu  ni ['to  the love-vims'] or reezaa o abiseru ['to  delete  with  a laser"]. I  can  delete  it.  Bing!  Bing! Then  he  is all  mine  again. Just  like  the Japanese  computer  say to you: the file  has been  trashed!

Yuming's song is fraught  with  unusual  tropes  and  metaphors  from  English. The  most  obvious  one  is probably puroguramu ni goosuto ga  iru, ' t h e r e  is a ghost in  the program'. This  seems  to  be  an  interesting  combination  of  the pure English  idioms,  'a  bug  in  the  program'  and  'a  ghost  in  the  machine'.  As  far as  I  know, Japanese  has  neither  of  these  notions,  and  the  concept  of  a  real Japanese  ghost  (say,  an o-bake) i n h a b i t i n g  a  c o mputer  would  probably  strike most Japanese  as  ludicrous. 3 Other  cases  from  this  song  include  someone editing you (anata-o  edito-shite  iru) to  mean  to  change  a  lover's  mind,  and  'love virus' (koi  no uirusu), meaning  to  become  smitten  by another  woman.

As  we  have  seen  in  Chapter  5,  expected  and  unusual  English l o a n word metaphors  abound  in  many  songs  and  poems  by Japanese  women. Wink talks about  the jewel-like starry  sky (jueru-na hoshi-zora) o u t  o n  the  night  the  couple breaks  up  in  'Boys  Don't  Cry'. Princess Princess tells  of  the 'party is  j u s t beginning' (paatii wa  kore kara) to  describe  the  rest  of  a  young  girl's  life  in ' D i a m o n d s ' .  Y u m i n g  portrays  the flare of  the  crests  of  the  waves (nami no fuereaa) and  the  white lace of  bubbles (shiroi  reesu  no  awa) during  her  walk along  the  beach  in  'Sand  Castles'.

However,  the  images  in  this  song,  about  the  computer  and  the  missing boyfriend,  are  especially  creative. Yuming  sets  her  context  -  the  room  and its  e q u i p m e n t  -  using  English  loanwords;  she  describes  the  danger  and fear using  English  loanwords,  and  she  offers  her  solutions  again  with  borrowed terms.  The  impressions  here  are  more  than just  of  a  high-tech  Frankenstein r u n n i n g  amok.  The  woman's  main  concern  is  that  a  rival  may  infect her boyfriend  with  a  'love virus'. No  doubt  she  is  speaking  of  computer  viruses here,  and  not  the  medical  kind.  However,  it  is possible  that Yuming  is  being even  more  metaphorical:  one Japanese  person  suggested  to  me  that  the  virus may actually be  the  computer  itself, which  takes up  too  much  of the  boyfriend's time  and  attention.  She  may  actually  regard  the  computer,  then,  as  her  main rival.

In  any  case,  it  is  unsettling  that  all  this  m o d e r n  equipment  cannot offer her  some  security  even  when  her  boyfriend  is alone. With  her  typically  gentle humour  and  clever  use  of  language, Yuming  has  created  an  exotic  world,  but one  that  we  can  understand,  and  even  be  drawn  into.

## Tawara  Machi: The  modern  woman's  poet

This  use  of  a  'new  rhetoric'  is also  seen  in  the  works  of Tawara  Machi,  the  poppoet  sensation  whom  we  also  met  in  Chapter  5. 4 As  I  have  mentioned earlier, she  has  almost  single-handedly  revitalized  the Japanese  classical tanka poetry form  (Stanlaw,  1993a;  2000a),  and  I believe  the  tremendous  appeal  of  Tawara's work  is due  to  her  fresh  language  and  images  many  of which  are  parented  in English.  She  brings  to  her  poems  an  almost  conversation  tone,  and  discusses

common  everyday  subjects  and  contemporary  themes  that  most  people  can relate  to.  Consider  the  venue  in  the  following  poem  (Tawara,  1987:  156):

'genki de ne' Makudonarudo  no katasumi  ni saigo no tegami kaki-agete ori

Tn  the  corner at McDonalds, writing 'Take  care, OK!'  in  my last letter  to  you'

In  more  traditional tanka, instead  of  a woman  writing  her  goodbye  letter  in  a corner  at McDonald's,  other  author  might  place  her  at the  foot  of some  famous bridge  or  mountain,  or  in  some  obscure  remote  inn  of  special  significance. More  importantly,  Tawara's  poems  abound  in  English  images  and  loanwords, as  we  have  seen  in  almost  every  example  of  hers  in  the  last  chapter.

## English: A second  importation  and  a second  women's  voice

In  medieval Japan,  men  and  women  occupied  separate  worlds  physically, linguistically,  and  psychologically.  Today  vernacular  Japanese  and literary Japanese  are  not  so  different,  and  the  linguistic  sexual  dimorphism  is by  no means  as  distinct.  Sino-Japanese  characters  and  'Chinese'  readings  are  used universally  by all, as are  the  imported  and  created-injapan  English  loanwords. While  there  are  differences  in  topic  and  register  (1992b),  both  men and women  seem  equally  adept  and  prone  to  use  the  thousands  of  English resources  available  to  most  native Japanese  speakers.

However,  many  differences still  exist,  a n d  are  well-documented (e.g. Adachi  and  Stanlaw,  n.d.;  Cherry,  1987; Endo,  1995; Shibamoto,  1985;  1987). One  area,  to  use just  one  example,  is  'politeness'.  Polite  forms  in Japanese  for  both  genders  -  can  be  quite  complex,  and keigo ( ' h o n orific l a n g u a g e ' ) syntactically  incorporates  exalted,  humble,  and  plain  linguistic  forms  (Mizutani and  Mizutani,  1987). However,  there  are  also several  other  ways that  politeness can  be  expressed,  and  most  of  the  time  these  co-vary with  markers  for  gender in  Japanese.

Female  members  of  one  of  the  nationally-known Japanese  debate  teams t o l d  me  a  few  years  ago  that  it  is  almost  impossible  for  women  to  be argumentative  in Japanese;  and  as  far  as  they  knew,  all  debating  contests  in Japan  that  involved  women  were  conducted  in  English.  Although  this  is just an  anecdotal  case,  there  seems  to  be  little  doubt  that Japanese  women are restricted  in  certain  ways when  saying  certain  things.

I believe  that  it is not  accidental  that  the  songs, poems,  and  other  examples presented  here  involve  the  extensive  use  of  English  loanwords.  In  the  area  of

verse,  it  is likely  that  English  loanwords  provide Japanese  people  with  another voice  -  a  symbolic  vocabulary  -  in  which  to  express  their  thoughts and feelings.  Sometimes  there  are  feelings  that  women  cannot  express  in t h e medium  of Japanese,  and  the  use  of  loanwords  may  circumvent  some  of  these sociolinguistic  restrictions.  For  example,  consider  the  following  excerpt  from a  r e c e n t  song  by  the  veteran  singer  Takeuchi  Mariya, Honki-de onrii yuu ('Seriously,  Only You'), where  she  describes  an  action  that  few  women  would probably  undertake  directly  in  the Japanese  language  -  the  proposal  of marriage:

Now let's get  married No need  to wait and waste our  time Why do we have to carry on  this way? No one  can  keep  us  apart So, let's  get  married  right  away

I'll  wake you  up in  the  morning,  my baby Sweeten your coffee  with my kiss And  in  the  night And  in  the  night Whisperin'  the words you long  to  hear So, let's get  married

The  song  is  totally  sung  in  pure  English (compare  this  to  the  pure  classical Chinese  of  the  men's  voice  a  thousand  years  ago,  which  was  almost  pure Chinese). Frankly, it is hard  to imagine  a more  explicit  marriage  proposal  than this;  I  d o u b t  t h a t  t h e  same  thing  could  be  said  in  the  same  way  in pure Japanese.  Later  in  the  song,  she  even  directly  asks for  any  affection  she  might need,  another  emotion  not  readily  expressed  by many Japanese  women:

I'll  give you  a smile  to cheer  you  up

But if I get sad  and  lonely Please  hug  me  close and wipe my tears So, let's  get  married

Again,  needless  to  say,  such  candid  and  heartfelt  sentiments  are  rarely uttered  in  the  normal  Japanese  language,  especially  by Japanese  women. However,  there  are  certain  times  and  registers  where  we  can  indeed  find  such expressions. Jealousy  is one; enka music  is another.  For  instance,  in enka music we  hear  famous  female  singers  like  Ishida  Sayori,  Mori  Masako,  or  Miyako Harumi  say  things  like daite  daite or namida was fuite ('Hold  me,  hold  me!', ' Wipe  away  my  tears!').  But  there  seems  to  be  a  different  kind  of  feeling  in this  older  'country-western'  style. As one  informant  said,  'In enka t h e  m o o d is

heavy,  and  it  always  sounds  as  if  the  woman  is  going  to  be  dumped.  In kayookyoku [Japanese popular music] we don't get that feeling. English  doesn't have  this  "dumpy"  feeling!'

## Conclusion: Japanese  women's voices, then  and  now

Any group  that has restricted  access to the dominant  modes of expression will in some sense always be 'muted'. Women in many societies are one such group, with Japan  being just  one  example.  These  non-dominant  groups  are  not necessarily  silent  or  unnoticed;  women  often  speak  a great  deal,  to  be  sure. As we have seen, Japanese women actively invented a number  of literary  forms in  medieval  times, including  the  poetic  diary  and  personal  narrative  novel. These  non-dominant  groups  are  'muted'  because  their  model  of reality  and world-view cannot  be symbolized,  represented,  or  imparted  in  the  dominant discourse.  The  subordinate  group,  then,  is  forced to  structure their understanding  of  the  world  through  the  model  of  the  dominant  group. However,  it  is  through  ritual,  art,  and  other  symbolic  expressions  of performance  that  these  groups  may express  themselves  in ways apart  from, or  in  spite  of,  dominant  group  standards.

Table  6.1  shows  how Japanese  men  and  women  differed  in  terms  of language  use  about  a  thousand  years  ago,  depicting  the  private  sphere  of women  using  the  indigenous  Yamato Japanese  vocabulary  written  in  the hiragana syllabary. Yet in  the  twenty-first  century,  it is likely that  differentiation will continue  in Japan,  as shown  in Table  6.2.

Table  6.2 Japanese  discourse  in  the  second  millennium  circa  2050

|          | Women                                  | Men                               |
|----------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| language | Japanese English, Standard Japanese    | Standard Japanese                 |

| genre    | music, poetry etc. institutional prose | institutional prose, other genres |
| persona  | increasingly public                    | public; increasingly private      |

Here  I predict  that Japanese women will continue  to borrow, or create,  more and more English-based linguistic forms. It is possible that roman  letters might be  increasingly  used,  as Japanese  consumer  culture  and  advertising  become

even more reified  because  of the  increasingly intensive and  ubiquitous  effects of  advertising  and  the  media  (Stanlaw,  2001). As Japanese  women  become more  confident  and  economically  powerful,  they  may  also  become  more prominent  in the public sphere  (Tamanoi,  1990). However, it is quite  possible that  they will do  so in  their  own  linguistic  terms. It is even  possible  that  they will  come  to  dominate  the  current  importation  of English  into  the Japanese language. Regardless of what the future  may bring, the judicious use of English loanwords will give Japanese women  greater  rhetorical  power, more  linguistic options, and  perhaps  even  more  freedom,  than  they have  previously  had.

## Using  the  graphic and  pictorial image to explore  Japan's 'Empire of  Signs 9

## Introduction 1

On  the  back  cover  of  the  J u n e  2001  issue  of Gengo ( ' L a n g u a g e ' ) was  the following  fascinating  advertisement  for  a website  for  books:  Ctlfi  ^ ~Ct" (kore wa ' Wt desu, ' This  is  a  "  Irc  ".',  a n d  I will  explain  this  character  in  a  m o m e n t ) . At  the  end  of  this  sentence  was  the  drawing  of  a  foreboding-looking person with  a  suspicious  glass  in  his  hand.  The  reason  why  this  advertisement  was  so intriguing  is the  interesting  way  the  sentence  is constructed  around  the  SinoJapanese  character  '  M  '. The  rest  of  the  sentence  is in hiragana. It  is  probably t he  first  basic  pattern  someone  learning  to  read  or  write Japanese  will  study: Kore  wa  A  desu ('This  is  [an]  A').  Therefore,  we  could  in  theory  hear  or  see something  like  Ctlli  TJOTlrJ Vt(kore wa  'doku-sho' desu, ' This  is  "reading".' with  the  two  characters l^lr [doku plus sho] t o g e t h e r  meaning  'reading'). Obviously, in both Japanese  and  English  this sentence  sounds  unnatural  (which is  why  I  put  the  quote  marks  around  'reading'  and  wrote in  theory) but  it  is t h e  s e n t e n c e  structure  I  am  focusing  on  at  the  moment.  Now,  here  is  where t he  verbal  and  oral  puns  come  in. Another  common  phrase  is  Ctlte  T^J T f Kore  wa  'doku'  desu, ' This  is  "POISON",'  as  in  a  label  or  warning  on  a  bottle telling you  not  to  drink  it  (which  is a  perfectly  fine  sentence,  theoretically  and practically).

As we  have  seen  in  the  previous  chapters,  most  Sino-Japanese  characters have  several  possible  pronunciations.  Thus  word  for  'to  read'  H  (usually  read as yomu when  used  by itself with  the hiragana verbal  suffix ts as  in Wtts) can  be pronounced  as doku in  combination  with  some  other  characters.  By  placing t h e  character  in Japanese  parenthetical  quote  marks  in  the  advertisement, however  (and  not  putting  it in  its  normal  infinitive  form: Wtts  yomu, the  verb ' t o  r e a d ' ) ,  t h e  pronunciation doku (as  poison)  is suggested  as  this  is  the  first character  in  the  compound  l^tr (which  is  read  as doku). That  is,  the  word meaning  'poison' ( M  ) and  the  first  character  in  the  combination Hit ( meaning  'reading')  have  the  same  pronunciation, doku. The  next  step  is  to

realize that the word for poison, doku (M), can also occur in compounds such as the one for 'addiction': *PM  huudoku. This suggests that 'reading' is not only dangerous, but can also be a poison  (as explicidy indicated by the picture in the advertisement with the glass of an unknown substance); reading is also addictive. This long chain of implications, then, goes something like this:

<!-- image -->

chuu-doku

addictive

The  key to  this  orthographic  double-entendre  is not  only  the  way the  SinoJapanese  characters  are  read  in  phrases  or  by themselves,  but  also  how  they suggest  other  homophones.  The  implication  of  this  is not  that  it is  actually deadly  to  read  books,  but  that  books  certainly  are  addictive.  It  is  therefore not just  the  case  that  'This  is poison';  it is also the  case  that  'This  [website]  is reading'  and  'This  website  is addictive'.  In Japanese,  this  word  play -  or character  play - is very humorous  and  attractive.  It  may sound  extremely complicated  and  dull  when  dissected  in  this  way,  but Japanese  people instantaneously  'get'  the jokes  and  puns  right  away. In  this  chapter,  we will examine just  such word  games - but  those  in a Japanese  English  context.

Westerners have long been fascinated  by the visual intricacies of Japanese life.  The  colour  of  kimonos,  the  visible  texture  of  foods,  the  asymmetrical shapes of  Japanese paintings and gardens - all these have been noted by those who  take  delight  in  reading  the  text  of  'visual Japan'.  Roland  Barthes,  the famous French semiotician, went so far as to label Japan  the  'Empire of Signs' (1982), claiming  that  the  simplest  of gestures in  the  country  are  loaded  with significance.

Walking down  any street  at night  in  even  the  smallest village  in Japan  is certainly a feast for  the eyes. Entrees include neon signs with colourful  Chinese characters,  and  shops with wonderful  plastic  models  of  their wares. Japan  is undoubtedly  a visual  culture,  but  perhaps  no  more  so than  any other.  More important,  however, is the fact  that much  of this visual diet is borrowed.  Apart from  the Coke signs and cigarette advertisements on billboards, English words and  phrases  are  almost  compulsory  on  television  commercials,  in books,  and

Figure  7.1 A Japanese street at night: A visual feast for  the eyes

<!-- image -->

on  shirts,  sweaters,  handbags,  and  personal  artefacts  of  all  kinds.  Thousands of  English  loanwords  are  found  in  everyday  speech,  and  English  orthography is  f o u n d  in  a  multitude  of  contexts.  Such  a  visual  delight  as  seen  in  Figure 7.1  can  be  seen  in  all Japanese  towns  and  cities.

Here  I will  explore  this  extensive  use  of  English  borrowings  and  graphic images  that  dominate  the  visual  world  of Japan.  I will  again  argue  that  these English  signs  are  not  mere  imitations  of  the  West,  or  a  kind  of  linguistic pollution.  Instead,  I propose  that  they  represent  a  highly  creative  use  of  visual l a n g u a g e ,  both  as  a  linguistic  -  and  artistic  -  form  of  communication. English  and  English  orthography  have  been  incorporated  into  the  Japanese symbolic  vocabulary, just  as  Chinese  writing  was  brought  in  over  a  thousand years  ago.  T h e  English  writing  represents  one  more  resource  available  to Japanese  speakers.  In  fact,  the  argument  could  be  made  that Japanese and English  are  treated  today  almost  as if they were  the  same  language,  at  least  in t heir  written  form.  I will  conclude  with  some  comments  on  how  Americans and Japanese  view this use  of English  by Japanese,  and  how  this  use  of  English might  help  foreigners  learn  to  'read'  a  'visual'Japan.

## The  'pentagraphic' Japanese  writing  system

## Native  Japanese orthographies

The  anthropologist  Charles  Ferguson  in  his seminal  work  on  language  mixing (1959)  coined  the  term  'diglossia'  to  describe  a  situation  where  two  different varieties  of  a  spoken  language  can  co-occur  in  a  speech  community.  Each variety seems  to  have  special  uses and  functions,  or  different  roles and  registers. Other  linguists,  by  analogy,  have  termed  situations  where  there  is more  than one written  version  of a language  as 'di-graphia'.  In Japan,  however,  there  seem to  be  at  least  five  written  versions  which  often  co-exist  in  the  same  text.  First, t h e r e  are  the  famous  Sino-Japanese (kanji) characters  used  to  write  many concrete  and  abstract  nouns  and  verb  roots.  The hiragana syllabary  is  used  to write  particles,  inflections,  adverbs,  and  the  many  other Japanese  nouns  or verbs  that  do  not  use kanji characters. Katakana is like  a  Japanese  italics.  Finally, Japanese  also  uses rooma-ji (literally  meaning  'roman  letters'),  one  of  several romanization  systems  available.  These  four  orthographies  can  often appear in  the  same  sentence,  as the  simple  example  in  Table  7.1  (p. 147)  shows.  'Pure' English  can  also  be  used  in  modern  Japanese.  For  example,  Table  7.2  shows five  different  ways  that  the  name  'Japan'  could  be  written. 2

All  of  these  renditions,  including  the  English  version,  might  appear  in a  text,  especially  in  newspapers  or  magazine  advertising  copy. These  plethoras of  writing  systems  available  to  most Japanese  allow  for  some  very  creative usage, whether  in visual  or  linguistic  puns  or  in  the  calligraphic  arts  (Stanlaw, 2001b).  Considering  the  magazine  example 3 given  in  Figure  7.2  (p.148)  we see:  (1)  Chinese  characters  (for  much  of  the  text  in  the  paragraph),  (2) t h e native hiragana syllabary (for  verb  endings  and  so  on), (3) katakana for nativized  foreign  words,  names,  and  places,  such  as arubamu taitoru -  the English  loanword  'album  title'  -  in  the  first  line,  and  (4) rooma-ji, J a p a n e s e transcribed  into  the  roman  alphabet  (such  as in  the  young  lady's  name, Mari Hamada).

## Japanese and the  Western alphabet

Perhaps  a  fifth  kind  of writing  might  be  counted  if we wanted  to  consider  'real' English,  taken  in  an  unmodified  forms  (such  as Open  Your Heart  \x\ the  article heading  in  Figure  7.2),  to  be  different  from  romanized  Japanese.  Japanese might  thus  be  termed  'quadra-graphic'  or  'pentagraphic'.  The  difference  I  am claiming  between  Japanese  written  in rooma-ji orthography ' r o m a n i z e d Japanese'  as Takashi  (1990)  and  others  call  it,  and  'pure'  English  written  in  a ' n o r m a l '  Western  letters  is  possibly  one  that  not  every Japanese  would  agree with.  Both  are  using  the  roman  alphabet,  after  all,  and  Japanese  words  -

depicting Japanese  things  -  can  be  written  with  them.  (Likewise,  English words depicting Western  things can be written in Japanese katakana.) However, I  think  that  they are  sufficiently  dissimilar  to merit  distinction.

First,  transcribing  things  into  roman  letters  - and how to  do  so -  has been  a  highly  debated  and  contentious  issue  in Japan.  As we  have  seen  in Chapter  4  (see  also  the  Appendix),  each  of  the  various  systems  has  its  own merits and  deficiencies,  and even the Japanese government  has avoided  taking an  official  stand  on  adopting  one  particular  romanization  system  over  the others. Each  person  or  agency has their  own preference.  Second, when  I am speaking of rooma-ji versus  'pure'  English,  I am  trying to distinguish  between the  'look  and  feel'  -  to  borrow  a business  metaphor  - between  these  two 'products'. Although  technically all use the same set of orthographic  symbols, each  makes  different  impressions  on  both  native  and  non-native  Japanese speakers.

Thus,  for  example,  if  we  want  to  write  the  name  of  a  famous  Japanese newspaper  by just  using  a  Latin  alphabet,  we  find  that  it  could  be r e n d e r e d in  several ways:  'Asahi  Shimbun',  'Asahi  Shinbun',  or  'Asahi  Sinbun'  in  several romanization  systems, or  'The  Daily Asahi'  or  'The  Asahi  Newspaper'  in  'pure' English.  Or  to  use  another  example,  seeing  the  words  'Japan'  versus  'Nippon' on,  say,  athletic  uniforms,  could  signify  something  potentially i mportant, although  this  is very  hard  to  quantify.  I find  it  more  than  a  little  curious  that t he Japanese  national jerseys  for  the  1964  Olympics  used  the  English  name ' J a p a n'  while  those  in  2002  used  the rooma-ji-lettered ' Nippon'.  While  one  can certainly  make  too  much  of  such  things,  I would  not  dismiss  claims  such  as ' Nippon'  being  a  reflection  of  'new Japanese  confidence'  or  'Japanese  national identity  in  the  twenty-first  century'  immediately  out  of  hand.  In  any  case,  I would  have  liked  to  have  been  in  the  room  to  hear  the  discussion  when  this decision  was  made.  These  differences  between Japanese  rendered  in rooma-ji and Japanese  written  in  regular  English  can  also  be  seen  when r o manized Japanese  terms  are  used  in  English.  For  example,  the  term  'Nippon'  often  at  least  to  m e  -  carries  sarcastic  or  racial  overtones,  especially  in such collocations  as  'the  Gods  of  Nippon'  or  'Nipponese'  in  books  on  the  Second World  War.

Finally,  there  is  the  question  of  accuracy.  There  are  several  fine  points  of J a p a n e s e  phonology  that  appear  in  the kana system  but  which  are often i g n o r e d  in  'regular'  English  orthography.  The  best  example  of  this  is  vowel l e n g t h ,  which  is  phonemic  in Japanese.  This  means  that  a  vowel  held  for  a l onger  duration (or mora) implies  a  semantic  difference  from  one  held  for  a shorter  period  of  time  (e.g. i-e ' h o u s e '  versus i-i-e ' n o ' ) .  T h e r e  are  various  ways these  might  be  indicated  in  roman  letters,  such  as  repeating  the  vowel,  using a  macron,  or  placing  an  'H'  after  the  long  vowel.  Thus,  the  typical  Japanese family  name Ono, with  a  long  initial  vowel,  could  be  written  as Ohno,  Oono, or ono. I  would  say  that  the  name  of Japan's  capital,  then,  is written  as  'Tokyo'  in regular  English  or  'Tookyoo'  in Japanese  roman  letters. As Japanese  speakers are  aware  of  this  difference,  one  can  easily  tell  whether  something  is  written in  regular  English  or rooma-ji, I  t h i n k  the  distinction  is  worthwhile.

## The  influence  of English  on Japanese  orthography

One  way  of  trying  to  sort  out  the  confusion of  the  intermixing  of  Japanese and  English  is  to  compare  orthography  with  the  degree  of  borrowing.  Such an  attempt  is  illustrated  in  Table  7.3  (p.150).  Of  course,  this  table  is  a  mere heuristic  device,  and  vastly  oversimplifies  a very  complex  linguistic  situation.

The  rows  on  the  left  side  of  Table  7.3  label  the  various  types  of  writing systems  used  in  modern Japanese: kanji characters, rooma-ji r o man  letters,  and t h e  two  syllabaries (katakana and hiragana). In  the  two  columns  on  top  are

two types of borrowing:  'pure'  English  and  items of  'domesticated'Japaneseinfluenced  English. These are extremes of a continuum,  indicating the  degree of closeness a lexical  item  or  phrase  may have  to forms  found  in, say,  Britain or America. Obviously, phrasing things in this way is to a certain  extent  biased; both  kinds  of  borrowings  are  actually real J a panese.  However,  we  might presume  that some  'pure'  English  forms would  be more  easily recognized  by most native English speakers, so we might think of them  as direct  borrowings. 'Domesticated' Japanese-influenced  English,  on  the  other  hand,  are  those forms which are most home-grown; they are generally 'made-injapan  English'. The  English  here  may  bear  only  passing  resemblance  to  anything  native speakers  are  likely to  recognize.

By looking  at  the  examples  given  in  Table  7.3, we  might  gain  a  better perspective  on  how  the  English  language  and  the Japanese  orthography  are

interacting  during  language  contact.  I will  now  present  and discuss  examples from  all twelve  cells  (although  obviously  not all are of equal  importance  or frequency).

## 'Pure' English in Rooma-ji

A lot of the  English  that  is directly  borrowed  into Japanese  is brought  in with r o man  letters.  Many  song  titles - such  as "Diamonds  , a hit song by the female rock  group Princess  Princess we  discussed  earlier  - are examples  of this  kind of  borrowing.  Other  common  ways  that  roman-lettered  English  is used  are in magazine  titles  and building  or company  names.

The  names  of rock  and roll  musicians,  however,  are some  of the  best examples  of this  type of English.  Figure  7.3 shows  part  of the  table  of contents from  a  1999  music  magazine, Uta-bon, (that  is, 3 f t [BON\, ' Song-book'),  written in  both  characters  and roman  letters.

<!-- image -->

Most  of  the  names  of  the  performers  featured  in  this  issue  are  'pure' English  (e.g. 'Judy and  Mary , 'Puffy  , or 'Speed), or  some  close variant  (e.g. the 'Kinki  Kids', meaning  not just  'kids' with  'kinky'  lifestyles,  but  also  boys from  the Kinki Osaka-Kyoto region  of  Japan). The  few other  names written  in katakana are  (  i/V--7, Jr.  or  Janice, Jr.',  P U -$ 1 8 ^ , or  'Lolita  No.  18') Japanized  versions of English  terms.

English  in  roman  letters is not  restricted  to commercial  or  product  uses, however.  A few  years  ago,  a  number  of  local  agencies  had  an  anti-litter campaign  centred  on  the  theme Clean  Up Japan. The  Yokohama  city government placed Clean Up  Japan posters in train stations, subways, and  other public  places  (see Figure  7.4).

Figure  7.4 'Clean  Up Japan advertising  campaign

<!-- image -->

## 'Domesticated' English  in Rooma-ji

As we have seen, a lot of the  English  in Japan  is the  home-grown  variety.  The Japanese-ness'  of these  'borrowed-creations'  is easily detected,  even when  the words are written  in  roman  letters. For  example,  the Japanese  divide  up  the teenaged years into roo tiin ('low  teens', from  around  thirteen  to fifteen)  and hai tiin ('high  teens',  from  sixteen  to  nineteen).  In  1989, one  magazine  did

an  interview with  a pop idol who was just  making  her  debut  on  the  music  scene. The rooma-ji title  was Big  Lowteen  Kumiko Takeda; presumably,  she  was  a  fifteenyear-old  'low  teen'  who  was  going  to  make  it  'big'  soon.  The  next  story  was about Cover  Photojenic Yumi  Morio, a  young  woman (Yumi  Morio)  who  was becoming  successful  in  the  modelling  field (as  a  ' p h o t o g e n i c ' ' c o ver' girl, presumably).

As  the  above  examples  show,  English  spelling  and  semantics  are  not  of primary  concern in  J a p a n e s e ' d o m e s t i c a t e d ' English.  In  fact, English morphemes  in  roman  letters  -  of  all  kinds  -  are  likely  to  be  used for linguistic  jokes  and  visual  puns,  or  attention-grabbing  signs  or  titles.  For example,  one  of the  most  popular  comics for 'high teenagers  and  young  adults is  Takahashi  Rumiko's  science  fiction  story Urusei  Yatsura. 4 Figure  7.5  shows  a back-page  advertisement  of one  issue; its headline  reads Rumic  Fantasy  World . . . ENTERTAINMENT FOR  YOU. 5 Most  of  these  English  words  above  are  using  smaller katakana symbols,  approximating  these  English  sounds.  The  one  exception  is the  author's  name, Rumiko ( fall 1 ?-  ) Takahashi (  iftff ).  Here,  her  first  name  is broken  down  into  its  component  syllables,  that  is, in  its  component  parts, Ru (  m ), Mi (  H ),  a n d Ko  (  ^ ) . An  interesting  word  game  is  played here, combining  the  English  adjectival  marker  '-ic'  written  in katakana (  -4v9 ) with  the  first  two  Chinese  characters  of  her  name ( B§H) ,  creating  the  new adjective Rumic (  mjkvt? ),  t h a t  is, eaU (Rumi-) plus 4v9(-ic) allows  for t he  roman-lettered Rumic (i.e. Rumiko + ic) to  be  constructed.  Not  only  is  this a  clever  play  on  the  romanized  version  of  the  author's  name (Rumiko in kanji becoming Rumiikku in katakana and  then Rumic in rooma-ji), t h e  i n t e n t i o n is probably  also  to  mean  something  like  a  'fantasy  world  that  is Rumiko-\ike', or ' a  fantasy  world  created  by Rumiko'.

Figure  7.5 Rumiko  Takahashi's  Fantasy  Cartoon  World

<!-- image -->

An  even  more  interesting  example  of  such  'punning'  can  be  found in Figure  7.6.  This  shows  the  front  cover  of  the  first  issue  of  a  popular  detective comic  book  series, Katsushika Q in  the  1990s. 6 On  the  very  top  we find t h e author's  name, written  in  English,  as it says, 'Chinatsu  Tomisawa  Presents'.  The main  title,  however,  is written  in  both  roman  letters  on  top  (with  the  drawing of  a  p e n g u i n  sticking  out  of  the  Q-letter)  and  in Japanese  characters  in  the lower  right-hand  corner  (  HtfiQ. ).  (This  comic  book  hero  is not a  cartoon penguin;  the  reason  for  this  drawing  will  be  apparent  in  a  moment).

Katsushika-ku is  a  r a t h e r  seedy  ward  in  old  Tokyo,  the  area  where this detective  works.  Unlike  the  bars  where  the  hard-boiled  private  eyes  of American  film  and  novel  noir  hang  out,  the  place  out  of  which  this  hero operates  is a  local  coffee  shop  with  the  unpretentious  name  Q.  English  names for  coffee  houses  are extremely common  in Japan,  so this in  itself is not  unusual. However,  the  detective's  name  is  written  in kanji characters  as  A (literally ' n i n e ' ,  but  it  can  be  pronounced  as  either ku or kyuu). This  might  be  his  real name  or just  a  number,  like James  Bond's  infamous  007  (we are  never  actually t old).  However,  the  story  does  indicate  that  this  written  character  should  be pronounced  as kyuu.

Figure 7.6 Katsushita Q cover

<!-- image -->

The  English  Q i n  the  title,  then,  comes  from  a  number  of  sources.  To  be sure,  it  is  the  n a m e  of  the  coffee  house.  But  it  is also  a  play  on  words  with  the Japanese  term  for  neighbourhood  or  ward, -ku (normally  written  as  IE  using characters).  This,  combined  with  the  detective's  name, Kyuu, A  , makes  for  a delightful  and  humorous  transformation  that  goes  something  like  this:

| Katsushika-ku   | M   | $$   | E   | (the Katsushika ward in Tokyo)                                                                   |
|-----------------|-----|------|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Katsushika-Q    | S   | I t  | Q   | (the coffee house in Katsushika)                                                                 |
| Katsushika-Kyuu | M   | Ifr  | ti  | (detective in both the Katsushika ward [ku], from the coffee house Q [kyu], named 'Nine' [kyuu]) |

To  top  things  off,  the  picture  of  a  penguin  (probably  thought  of  a  'pen-QUi n')  on  the  cover  no  doubt  adds  another  bit  of  English  visual  spice  to  these Japanese  hors  d'oeuvres,  attracting  the  reader  even  more."  This  type  of  visual and  linguistic joking  is fairly  common  in  many  registers  of Japanese,  and  may be  seen  in  product  names,  advertising,  comic  books,  to  name just  a few.  These graphic-sonic  puns,  mixing Japanese,  English,  and  writing  systems  of  all  kinds, are  probably  some  of  the  most  creative  uses  of  language  found  anywhere  in the  world.

However,  there  are  still  some  other  things  of  interest  in  Figure  7.6.  Even more  interesting,  in  some  ways, is the  fact  that  roman  letters  can  even  be  used to  write  actual  Japanese  words  and  phrases,  as  this  example  shows.  In t h e middle  of  the  page,  there  are  several  sentences  written  in  normal  Japanese, but  using rooma-ji r o m a n  letters:

```
KONO  HON  WA  TOTTEMO OTOKU  DESU OMOSHIROKIJTE TAME  NI NARU  HANASHI GA  29 WA  MO HAITTEMASU DAKARA KATTE KUDASAI
```

A  rough  translation  might  be:  'This  book  is a  real  bargain.  Inside  there  are  as many  as  twenty-nine  stories  that  are  both  interesting  and  good  for you. Therefore,  please  buy it.'  The  use  of roman  letters  to  'spell'  out  native Japanese words  is actually  not  as  uncommon  as  one  might  expect.  Figure  7.7  (p.  156), for  example,  shows  socks, with just  the  word kutsushita-ya written  on  the  cuff. Kutsushita simply  is  the Japanese  word  for  sock,  in  case  there  was  any  doubt what  you  were  wearing.

## 'Pure'  English  in katakana

Direct  borrowings  of  English  in katakana appear  in  a  number  of  different situations.  One  of  the  most  common  uses  is  seen  in  foreign language textbooks,  dictionaries,  or  other  places  where  the katakana acts  as  a pronunciation  guide  of  sorts. As in  the ENTERTAINMENT FOR  YOU example just presented,  the small katakana symbols give a clue as to how the English  words in the advertisement should be pronounced. Not only is this apparently visually pleasing,  it  might  also  be  helpful  to  children,  older  folks,  or  others  whose English  expressions  have not  been  kept  up  to  date.

Historically, such pronunciation guides are not new in the Japanese writing system. For centuries, small katakana ( termed furigana) have often  been  written alongside Japanese  characters  to  indicate  the  intended  readings.  This  was important  for  at least  three  reasons. First, as mentioned,  each Japanese kanji character  usually has at least two pronunciations,  and  sometimes  many  more. Second, the kanji inventory has only recently become standardized; before  the First  or  Second  World  Wars,  each  person's  knowledge  and  ability  to  use characters was quite idiosyncratic. Third, until the twentieth  century there was a  great  difference  between  written Japanese  and  the  spoken  vernacular.  This was especially  true  in  the  use  of  the  Chinese  readings  of  characters,  and  of Chinese-based  loanwords. Being  'literate'  in Japanese,  then, was problematic. It included  more  than just  being able to read  a certain  number  of characters, or  write  one's  name. When  mass-literacy  became  a  national  goal,  the  small katakana reading  aids were  indispensable  for  many  people.

The  use  of katakana in  some  situations  today  may  be  serving  similar functions  as the furigana in  historical  times. The  use  of katakana in  foreign

l a n g u a g e t e x t b o o k s  is  slowly  being  phased  out  for  pedagogical r e a s o n s . However,  the  function of katakana as  a  sort  of  reading  aid,  if  anything,  is i n c r e a s i n g  in  popularity.  More  and  more  frequently,  we  see  cases  like  the Takahashi  Rumiko  comic  example  above  where  titles, words  and  phrases  are given  in  English  roman  letters  while  accompanied  by  small  reading-aid or ' t r a n s l a t o r ' katakana. Examples  of  this  are  commonly  found  in Japanese  music groups,  whose  names  are  often  all  in  roman  letters.  In  fan  magazines  -  even ignoring  foreign  artists -  performers'  names  are  often  written  in  both  roman letters  together  with Japanese katakana. For  example,  Figure  7.8  shows  the ' i n d e x '  of  a  music  magazine  that  has katakana/ kanji listings  next  to  the  romanl e t t e r e d / E n g l i s h  music  group  names  appearing  in  that  issue. 8

The  'translator'  analogy  must  not  be  taken  too  strictly,  however.  There  is also  an  orthographic  aesthetic  quality  involved  because  these  reading-aids  or ' t r a n s l a t o r ' katakana are  often  used  with  names  or  words  that  almost  everyone in Japan  already  knows.  It  must  then  be  asked:  What  is  the  real  name  of,  say, a  rock  group?  Is  it Princess Princess in  r o man  letters  or  T^J &gt;iiX zf*J &gt;-teX  in katakana? Is  it  the katakana that  are  the  translators  of  the  roman  letters,  or  the other  way  around?

## 'Domesticated' English in katakana

There  is a  short  anecdote  circulating  among  Western  scholars  studying  Japan that  is  probably  apocryphal,  but  contains  an  element  of  truth:  a  little  girl  is standing  in  line  with  her  mother  at  the  local  hamburger  shop  waiting  to  be served  lunch.  She  turns  and  asks  her  parent,  'Mom,  do  they  have  McDonald's

in  America,  too?' Another  anecdote  (this one  is true)  tells of a young Japanese woman  in  the  United  States  who  tried  to  find ' g r e e n  peppers'  by  asking unsuccessfully  for piiman (the Japanese  word  for  them  -  a loanword,  but  from t h e  French piment). The  point  behind  these  stories  is  that Japanese  people often  do  not  really  know  -  or  care  -  if a  certain  term  is real  English,  'madei n J a p a n '  English,  or  some  other  foreign  word.  Like  feral  cats  hanging  around t he  barn,  all  seem  to  become  domesticated  eventually.

As  I  have  mentioned  several  times  before,  the  majority  of  all  loanwords present  in Japanese  are written  in katakana. This  includes  most  of  the  common loanwords  found  in  everyday  speech,  such  as rajio "yi/Jc ('radio')  or takushii ^ ^ y ('taxi')  as we  have  seen  in  Chapter  3 and  the  most  recent  borrowings. Some  of  these  words  and  phrases,  however,  are  not  transparent  to  native English  speakers,  as  they  are  'made  in Japan'  only  for  local  consumption.

A simple  example  is found  when  one  goes  to Makudonarudo (McDonald's). In  order  to  get  some  starch  to  go  with  your  hamburger,  instead  of ' f r e n c h fries',  you  must  request ~?z&gt;4 K/Kx  h  or furaidopoteto ('fried  potatoes')  as  seen in  Figure  7.9.

Figure  7.9 Japanese  french  fries: 'Fried Potato'

<!-- image -->

And gurasu biizu are  not  flying  insects  made  of  glass  that  sting  you,  but are  'glass  beads'.  A  'silver  seat'  (  vJU/\v- h  , or shirubaa shiito) is  a  spot ('seat') on  a  train  or  subway  reserved  for  senior  ('silver')  folks  (see  Figure 7.10).  This word  also  merits  some  more  exegesis.  In  Britain  or  North  America, t h e  word ' s i l v e r - h a i r e d '  is  a  well-known  moniker  for  an  older  person.  The Japanese  word shira-ga (literally  meaning  'white-haired') also  refers  to t h e elderly,  but  definitely  not  so  euphemistically.  So  even  though  some  Japanese

know  that  'silver'  hair  is  the  same  as  'white'  hair,  it  was  decided  that  the reserved seats for  older people should be called  'silver seats' rather  than  'white seats'  lest  the  elderly  not  use  them.

Figure  7.10 A Silver Seat for  senior  citizens

<!-- image -->

Some  phrases  are  quite  local,  even  though  they are  written  in katakana and  are  based  on  English  words.  For  example,  / W 7 7 &gt; y ^ (hai tiin  bugi, or  'high  teen  boogie')  refers  to  the  rebellious  attitude  of  some  Japanese teenagers. While  'high  teen  boogie'  has rather widespread  usage, other  madein-Japan  phrases are created  more  at the spur of the moment.  For example, a magazine  spread  introducing  the  model Ai Tomoko was titled  /\P-! ~^^^V 7 7 x 7 (Haroo!Mai  rabu afea, or  'Hello! My love affair').  Presumably, such  an expression  emphasizes  the woman's attractiveness, and  the vicarious  pleasures the  readers will have seeing  her.

## 'Pure' and  'domesticated' English  in hiragana

The hiragana syllabary  is rarely  used  to write  loanwords;  that  generally  is  the province  of  the  italics-like katakana ('italics'  in  the  sense  that katakana tend

to  be  conspicuous  and  stand  out  on  a  page).  A few  loanwords,  however,  have been  present  in Japanese  for  so  long  that  they  are  almost  considered  to  be native  terms.  For  example,  the  word tabako ('cigarette') is  usually  written  in hiragana: fcffCL.  The  number  of  such  terms  is very  small,  and  they  are  usually quite  nativized. A  'pure'  English  word  is almost  never found  written  in hiragana.

## 'Pure' English in kanji characters

As  mentioned,  the  Chinese  often  used  certain  characters  for  their  phonetic value  when  writing  loanwords  and  foreign  place  names. Japanese  sometimes use  characters  for  similar  purposes,  such  as writing  'Chicago'  with  the  three characters  ItrfSS.  However,  today, katakana is  m o r e  often used  to  write geographical  names,  as shown  in  Figure  7.11  (the  name, 'Shikagd i/h =f  , of  a young  person's  clothes  store  in  the  chic  Harajuku  area  of  Tokyo).  Therefore, English  can  be  written  in  Sino-Japanese kanji characters,  but  usually  for  less practical  or  utilitarian  purposes.

Figure  7.11 The Chicago Boutique

When Japanese  first  imported  the  Chinese  writing  system  over  1,500  years ago,  the kanji characters  were  toyed  with  in  games  and  poetry.  That  is,  the characters  were  manipulated  using  their  phonetic  value,  their  multiplicity  of meanings,  and  even  their  shape  or  form  to  create  a variety  of visual  and  verbal puns.  Today,  English  loanwords  are  sometimes  included  in  this  romp.  One such  example  was  found  in  the  slogan  of  the  1983  advertising  campaign  of J a p a n  Air  Lines  (JAL).  They  were  celebrating  the  twentieth  anniversary  of

JALPAK, their 'JAL special  'Packaged'  tours.  In  magazines  and  posters  all  over Japan, JALPAK' 84 was  hyped  with  the  phrase  / XEED  $t  . This  mixing  of  English and  Japanese  is  quite  interesting.  The  character j£! is  p r o n o u n c e d yuu, making  one  possible reading of  this  sentence  as  T  need  you'.  However, t h e meaning  of  the  character  is to  'play,  take  a  holiday,  be  idle'. Another meaning of  the  sentence  might  also  be  T  need  a  vacation',  which  is  exactly  what  the JAL  hoped  the  readers  would  think.  A  similar  example  is as  follows:  In  1998 the  tourist  association  of  the  historic  Izu  Peninsula  started  a  campaign (similar to JALPAK's)  using  the  phrase  THIS  IS if  a. ('This is Izu; t h e  character if  a. [Izu] being  pronounced  similarly  to  the  English  verb).  In  their  flyers,  pictures of  the  many  famous  places  in  the  area  were  shown  in  the  background in beautiful  colour  while  this  striking  phrase j u m p e d  right  out  of  the  middle  of t he  page.  As  the  Izu  Peninsula  is a very  popular  travel  spot  not  far  from  Tokyo (and,  incidentally,  the  former  name  of William  Adams,  the  first  Englishman in Japan  discussed  in  Chapter  3),  this  pun  is very  effective  advertising.  Ideas of  'THIS  is it!',  This  IS Izu!',  and  'Izu  is IT!'  all  simultaneously  come  into  mind as  this  intriguing  word  play  casts  a  hold  on  an  unsuspecting  reader.

## 'Domesticated' English in kanji characters

I n t h e  above  example,  a  Chinese character  was  used t o e x p a n d t h e connotations  of  a  phrase  directly  imported  from  English. Kanji can  also  be used  in verbal  play for  sentences  or  phrases  not  directly imported  from  English. For  example,  in  one  magazine  there  was  a  layout  of  a  nude  model  lying  in t h e  sand  of  the  South Seas.  The  title  was hP  t ^ ^ U g ^ V K^xJUfflP^/MJ ( Toropikaru  Ai-rando Modern  Taguchi  Yukari, or  'Tropical  Island  Model  Yukari Taguchi').  However,  the  phrase  'tropical  island'  was  not  all  written in katakana, as  we  might  expect (that  is, 74 ^4 &gt; K  or AIRANDO). Instead  of t h e katakana syllable Ai in ' i s l a n d ' ,  t h e  character  §|  was  used (which  has t h e  same  pronunciation  / a i / ) .  This kanji means  love  (both  physical  and mental).  Thus,  this  kind  of  ' Ai-lana" ( H ^ &gt; K  )  is  b o t h  a  geographical feature  and  a  land  of  pleasure  and  love.  The  connection  to  the  picture  is obvious.

One  other  interesting  example  of  this  type  is  the  name  of  the t e e n a g e rock  and  roll  roller-skaters,  Hikaru  Genji  (which  they  write  as % GENJI,  using t h e  J a p a n e s e  character  for  'bright'  and  the  proper  name Genji in r o m a n l e t t e r s ) . 9 Figure  7.12  shows  a  fan  wearing  a  T-shirt  with  this  logo.  What  is especially  intriguing  is that  the  hero  of  the  famous  eleventh-century  novel The Tale of Genji was also  called Hikaru Genji, the  'Shining  Prince',  though  obviously he  did  not  spell  his  name  as  do  these  youngsters.  As The  Tale of Genji is  to  t he J a p a n e s e  what  the  works  of  Shakespeare are to  English speakers, t h e connections  are  readily  obvious.  The  closest  English  equivalent  might  be  if

Hamlet  were  'spelled'  in  rebus-like  fashion  with  a  picture  of  a  pig  or  ham, combined  with  '-let'  (as, say,  in  something  like (§3 lef). The  fun  visual  play  of mixing  a Japanese  character  with  a  name  in  roman  letters  of  one  of  the  most famous  literary  figures  in Japanese  history  no  doubt  helps  account  in  some way for  this  group's  tremendous  popularity.

## 'Pure' English in  other ideographs

English  can  also  be  used  in  a variety of  other  ways, with  other  kinds  of  symbols or  pictographs.  For  example,  the  1980s  hit  song 'Mr.  Sailorman used an i n t e r e s t i n g  rebus-like  device  in  its  title.  T h e  first  part  was  written  with t h e English  word Me in  r o m a n  letters  followed  by  a  star-shape  (together  making the  word  'M^-star'  or  'Mister').  It  concluded  with  the katakana word seeraaman ('sailorman').  The  whole  song  title, then, was M e *  - f e y  "7&gt;  , a  rather  clever way  of  writing 'Mr.  Sailorman . Naturally,  such  visual  puns  are  not  found in every phrase  or  song  title, no  matter  how chic  or  hip.  However,  they do  appear with  a  fair  degree  of  regularity.

## 'Domesticated' English in  other ideographs

Japanese-style  English  can  also  be  used  with,  or  as,  other  kinds  of  visual symbols.  For  example,  the Wacoal clothing  line  once  had  an  advertisement  in magazines  and  billboards  showing  the  back  of a lady in  red  tights  slipping  into a  pair  of jeans,  as  shown  in  Figure  7.13. The  caption  read Hello 7  y  ~/J[/\iy  ~J

(Hello  Appuru Hippu, or  'Hello  Apple  Hips'),  with  the  initial  letter  forming the  shape  of  an  apple,  matching  the  picture. Although  'apple-hips'  might  not be  a  compliment  to  an  American  woman,  apparently  this  is  not  an  insult  in Japanese  English.

## Other  uses  of  'pure' English

A  common  example  of  other  kinds  of  'pure'  English  borrowing  can  be  seen on  clothes,  gym  equipment,  shopping  bags, and  personal  artefacts  of all  kinds, where  some  English  phrase  seems  almost  obligatory.  Here  the  use  seems  to be  highly  decorative,  with  less  attention  paid  to  the  semantics  of  the  English, or  the  appropriateness  of  the  occasion.  Off-colour  slogans  may  sometimes  be used,  but  more  often  what  seems  to  be  required  is just some kind  of  English sign.  Besides  American  university  or  product  logos,  a  variety  of  names or phrases  can  also  be  used.  On  one  T-shirt,  I once  saw  a  fifty-line encyclopedia entry  on  the  state  of  Georgia,  including  comments  on  its cash  crops  and  state bird.

One  other  example  is found  in  a  health  food  restaurant/organic  grocery in  northwest  Kyushu.  Here,  written  on  their  sign,  is  the  rather  bizarre  phrase

ti)\/ : &gt;0A£:fz'&lt; : £i~C3 (karushiumu o  tabemasu ka, maybe  translated  as  'Don't you  want  to  eat  some  calcium  [today]?'). 10 The  word  for  the  vitamin,  calcium, is  written  in katakana (as  it  is  a  borrowed  term),  and  the  verb tabemasu ('to eat') is  in hiragana, t h e  syllabary  used  for  native  words.  The  verb  'to  eat'  is used  here  to  imply  that  it  is  the  prepared  food  that  they  serve  that  contains t h e  vitamins  (as  opposed  to just  taking  home  a  supplement).  What  is  most intriguing,  however,  is that  the Japanese  question  particle ka - which  normally comes  at  the  end  of  an  interrogative  sentence  -  is  'spelled'  here  in  roman letters: Ga. ' C a '  is  t h e  chemical  symbol  for  calcium  from  the  periodic  table, and  when  it is also  used  here  to  represent  the  sentence-final  question  particle 1T&gt;  (ka), it  reinforces  both  the  sign's  power  of  suggestion  and  the  store's  claim of  offering  a  wholesome  menu.

## Other  uses  of'domesticated' Japanese English

The  above  samples  are  just  a  few  of  the  more  common  ways  English orthography  is used  in Japanese. A variety of other  devices are  also found.  One example  is  the  advertisements  for  the  interesting  [iXi:Z] Boutique collections of ANTI-DISESTABLISHMENTALIANISTCAL p r o d u c t s  (see  Figure  7.14). 11

Figure  7.14 Part of the  [fXi:Z]  collection

<!-- image -->

This  diabolical  modification  of  the  supposedly  longest  word  in  English  is i n t e n d e d  to  create  a  chic  and  non-conformist  impression.  Other  phrases  in their  advertisements,  such  as INDIMDUALEY BASIC, seem  to  support  this view.  They offer  a variety  of  items,  such  as TIME  GEAR (watches)  or ACTION GEAR (ties).  The name  is written  in  both  a  strange  and  imaginary  phonetic  alphabet, [fXi:Z] (presumably,  a sort  of approximation  of  the  International  Phonetic  Alphabet), a n d t h e katakana s y l l a b a r y , ^0i/-% 7 V y l - y a &gt; (Ikushiizu Asoshieeshon). The katakana word Asoshieeshon, of  course,  is  'association' in English. However,  what  is  not so  clear is [ i X i : Z ] .  According  to t h e a c c o m p a n y i n g katakana (  &lt;iOi/-"X ) , t h i s  word is s u p p o s e d t o be pronounced  as IKUSHIZU; a pparently  the  English  inspiration  for  this,  then,  is something  like  exceed,  excess,  excise,  or  excel.  Some  kind  of  play  on  words  is being  made  with  the  phonetic  symbolism  of  English  'exce-'  sounds,  but  it  is hard  to  say  for  certain  what  exactly  this  might  be.  O n e  informant  did  say, however,  that  perhaps  the  English  word  'exercise'  is now  so  mundane  that  its use  is  simply  passe.

Speaking  of  exercise,  one  last  example  of  these  kinds  of  word  games  is found  in  the  lower  corner  of Figure  7.15, a directory  of several  shops  in  a  highrise  building  in  the  fashionable  Ginza  area  of  Tokyo.  Here  we  see  the  sign  for t h e  ' United  Sports  Club',  a  gymnasium.  The  logo,  however,  consists  of  two r o man  letters  capital  X's  surrounding  an  upside  down  capital  A  (in  some  way making  the  shape  of  two  men  lifting  a  heavy  object).  The katakana word associated  with  this  sign  is eguzasu JLtf+fT.  , a word  that  is  not t r a n s p a r e n t ; nor  is it found  in  any of  the  dozens  of loanword  dictionaries  devoted  exclusively to  borrowed  words.  This  is another  created-in-Japan  item,  again  drawing  on t he  various  phonetic  symbolisms  associated  with  English  ex-sounds:  'excess', ' exotic',  'exist',  . . . and,  of  course,  the  now  un-cool  'exercise'.  This  glyph,  then,

'is a way of saying it, without  saying it',  to borrow  a post-modern  semiotic  image. One  other  way of viewing  things  is to  see  the  x-symbols  as  'stick  men' (e.g.  as X),  which  could  represent  people  exercising:  X  V  X.  If  the  upside  A  could be  read  as  an  'a',  then  these  could  be  intended  to  be  read  as  'eks'  'ah'  'size', which  is what  you  would  do  at  this  club.

## The  cline  of  orthography

Several  comments  should  be  made  about  Table  7.3  and  the  above  examples. First,  when  considering  orthography,  these  divisions  are  rather arbitrary. Placing  an  example  in  one  cell  or  another  requires  a value judgement  of  sorts. The  song  title 'Diamonds', for  example,  commonly  appears  in  both katakana and rooma-ji roman-lettered  forms;  theoretically  it could  therefore  go  in  either place.  Decisions  also  had  to  be  made  about  whether  a  form  was  thought  to be  a  direct  i m p o r t  -  but, ' h i d d e n ' , in t h e katakana writing  system, or something  made  in Japan.  The  phrase 74 "yV 3.(ai  rabuyuu, or  T  love you'),  even  when  written  in katakana, was obviously taken  directly from  English even  though  it  appears  in katakana. However,  the  song  title Boogie  Woogie Lonesome  High  Heel was not,  even  though  it  is written  in  roman  letters.

The  orthographies  are  often  mixed  together.  For  example, CfU - 4  &gt;97 y ~J (Gurooingu Appu  JUN, or ' Growing  u p j u n ' ) was  the  name  of  a  magazine pictorial  on  the  film  star  Miho Jun.  Here  English  loanwords  are  used,  written in katakana, while  her  first  name  is  printed  in  roman  letters.  Similar  things are  found  for  the  'translator'  phrases  discussed  previously.  For  example,  the rock  group ^^^^y (RomeKome  Kurabu, or  the  'Kome  Kome  Club')  uses  both katakana and kanji in  t h e i r  name,  or  sometimes  even  roman  letters or combinations  when  they write  it as 7^^ Club or KOME KOME CLUB (see  Figure  7.8). However,  this  interesting  use  of kana and kanji deserves  more  comment.  The traditional Japanese  word  for  'America'  is Beikoku (or  literally  'Rice  Country') using  the  characters %M  (bei ' r i c e '  and koku ' c o u n t r y ' ) .  The  other  way  of reading  T£  (the bei in Beikoku) is komi. Thus,  this  rock  group  is not  talking  about rice  at  all;  instead,  it  is  cleverly  suggesting  America.  O n e  could  say  that  here kanji is  being katakana-ized. Everyone  can  write  America  in  roman  letters  or katakana. In  a  sense,  dividing  orthographies  into katakana, kanji, or rooma-ji is t h e r e f o r e  misleading.  There  is  a  blending,  if  not  a  cline,  of  writing  systems being  used.

## The  cline  of  borrowing

The  second  point  to  notice  about  Table  7.3  is  the  cline  borrowing. For simplicity,  the  columns  are  divided  into  'pure'  English  and ' d o m e s t i c a t e d '

Japanese-influenced  English.  In  reality,  there  is again  a  continuum.  This  can easily  be  seen  in  the  five  examples  given  below:

- (1)  The  roman-lettered  phrase Clean  Up Japan is  n o  doubt  transparent  to native  English  speakers  (so it should  be  placed  under  the  'pure'  column), but  it  is  hardly  a  directly  imported  phrase (implying  that  it  is  made-inJapan  English).
- (2)  As we  have  seen,  many  loanwords  are  hybrid  truncations  or  combinations of  English  lexical  items,  making  them  undecipherable  to  native  English speakers  even  though  they  originally  were  simple  loans. For  example,  the rooma-ji l e t t e r e d APAMAN, t h e  name  of  a  Tokyo  househunter's  magazine, takes  its  n a m e  from  t h e  English  words  'apartment'  and  'mansion' (see Figure  7.16). 12 Are  these  kinds  of words  'pure'  borrowed  English,  or  madein-Japan  terms?  There  are  hundreds  of  such  problematic  cases.
- (3)  There  are  also  dozens  if  not  hundreds  of  roman-letter  acronyms  used  in everyday  Japanese,  as  we  have  seen  in  Chapter 3.  T h e s e are often pronounced  as if they were  real  words. JAL (JARU, J a p a n  Airlines'), OL  (OERU, 'office  lady',  a female  clerical  worker),  and CM (SHU-EMU, ' c o mmercial message')  are  but  a  few.  Again,  the  distinction  between  imported and domesticated  becomes  blurred.
- (4)  Phrases  in  different  orthographies  also  show  the  cline  of  borrowing.  For example,  when  the  roman-lettered  phrase HEAVY METAL  GAL MARI HAMADA (which  could  be  translated  into  'Mari  Hamada,  a  Gal  [Who  is a  Real  Hot and]  Heavy  Metal  [Fan]')  becomes  written  in katakana and kanji as  in ^  hi-* ^JU&amp;cD^^BajSil (Hebii  Metaru  Onna-no-ko  Hamada  Mari, or  'Heavy Metal  Girl,  Hamada  Mari'), it both  feels  and  appears  to  be  more  Japanese English-like. 13

- (5)  Finally,  mention  needs  to  be  made  of  the  thousands  of  products  in  Japan that  use  English  names, or  English-derived  names. Many of these  are  taken from  items  directly  imported  from  America.  However,  a very large  number of  these  product  names  are  created  in Japan.  The  Sony  WALKMAN -  one Japanese  name  that  became  popular  overseas  -  is but  one  example.

For  all  these  cases  -  from  product  names,  to  acronyms,  to  phrases  -  it is  n o t  easy  to  categorize  them  as  'pure'  English  or  Japanese  English'  forms.

## Explaining  the  use  of English  in Japanese  graphology

That  English  is  prevalent  in Japanese  is  obvious;  what  is  not  so  clear  are  the reasons  for  its  use.  Some  linguists  (e.g.  Pierce,  1971;  Quackenbush 1974; Haarman,  1984,  1989; Loveday,  1996)  argue  that  the  main  reason  for  the  use of  English  in Japanese  is due  to  prestige  factors.  That  is, foreign  elements  and Western  images  are  so  strong  that  the  mere  use  of  an  English  phrase  or  word automatically  elevates  a  discourse  register  to  a  higher  level.  Graphically,  this t h e o r y  could  be  drawn  as:

## PRESTIGE ===&gt;  ENGLISH

with  the  more  English  being  used,  the  greater  the  feeling  of  prestige  in  the text.

Although  for  some  people  there  are  chic  and  modern  aspects  of  English use,  it  is blatantly  obvious  that  the  situation  is much  more  complex  than  that. First,  not  all  views  of  America  and  the  West  are  complimentary. Negative images  are  seen  in  child's  gangster  comic  books,  or  in  television  shows  like &amp;&lt;5f5£tf 7-JUK ( l Naruhodo za  Waarudo', or  'Indeed,  The  World'),  which specializes  in  featuring  the  bizarre  and  the  deviant  from  other countries, especially from  the  United  States. If English  was so prestigious, one  would  think that  there  would  be  more  valiant  attempts  to  try and  'get  it  right'  (in  terms  of spelling,  grammar,  or  meaning).  Most  English,  however,  is the  made-injapan variety,  with  little  or  no  connection  to  native  speaker's  English  (and  this  lack of  connection  is  no  concern  to  most Japanese).

Even when  prestige is involved,  the  more  significant  effect  of English  seems to  be  the  creation  of a new  range  of emotional  categories  in Japanese,  as  Laura Miller  (1998)  has  suggested.  In  her  study  of  beauty  techniques  that  involve modifying  the  body -  including  everything  from  plastic  surgery  to  diet  drugs -  she  found  that Japanese  men  as well  as women  are  now  great  followers  of t h e s e  procedures.  The  name  for  this  practice  is esute ( s h o r t e n e d from 'aesthetic ) ; Miller  argues  that  men  are  followers  of esute as  they  have  now  come to  regard  themselves  as objects  of aesthetic  approval, just  as women  do.  I  have also  argued  (Stanlaw,  1992a,  1997a)  that  in  the  realm  of colour  terms, Japanese

might  experience  the  word  differently  when  thought  about  in  terms  of loanwords.  It  is these  new  emotional  and  cognitive  categories  that  seem  to  be more  critical  than  prestige  factors.

Table  7.4  (p. 170)  shows  some  of  the  other  possible  factors  involved  in  the use  of  English  loanwords  in Japanese.  Economics,  the  importance  of  English in  the Japanese  school  system,  and  various  historical  circumstances  may  be  as i mportant  an  influence  on  the  use  of English  as elements  of prestige.  However, I  would  posit  that  there  is  another  level  involved  that  needs  to  be  examined: a  milieu  of  cultural  rules,  social  standards,  and  linguistic  norms  in  which Japanese  English  and  the  reasons  for  its  use  operate.  This  is  shown  in t h e middle  'Mediators'  column  of  Table  7.4.  For  example,  when  made-in-Japan forms  are  created,  or  English  words  or  phrases  are  borrowed  and t r u n c a t e d , they  are  not  constructed  randomly  or  without  constraint.  Likewise,  when English  is  borrowed  for  its  orthographic  configurations,  it  is  not  done so without  regard  for  a Japanese  sense  of  aesthetics  or  artistic  conventions.

One  of  the  reasons  that  English  and  English  writing  may  be  so  prevalent is that  it is somewhat  constricting  to be  bound  to  a single  code  or  orthography. With  the  presence  of  English  loanwords  and  script,  the  variety  and  depth  of linguistic  messages  in Japanese  can  be  greatly  expanded.  Perhaps  it  is not  so simple  anymore  to communicate  solely in  one  medium  or  graphic  system.  New auxiliary  signs  and  symbols  may  be  needed.  Using  English,  the  Japanese conversational  registers,  discourse  strategies  and  written  media  can  be  made much  richer.

One  such  case  is  the  latest CM (' Commercial  Message'  or  advertising slogan)  for  Coca  Cola,  which  we  have  seen  in  Chapter  2.  It  is  not just t h e English  name  for  this imported  product  that  is of most  interest; from  a  semiotic and  sociological  perspective,  the  intriguing Japanese  English  phrase Zto'pfy x^T^x^r I feel  Cokel (Sawayaka, teisuti,  I feel  Coke!, or  'Refreshing,  Tasty,  I  Feel [like  having  a]  Coke')  is fascinating  in  not  only  its  language  mixing,  but  also its  orthography  (see  Figure  2.2,  p.  25).

This jingle  uses  three  scripts  and  two ways of writing loanwords. The  native Japanese  adjective SAWAYAKA (it  is  used  here  without  the  expected -na suffix required  when  modifying  a  noun)  means  something  fresh  or  refreshing.  The English teisuti ('tasty') is  written  in katakana, while  the  phrase I feel  Coke! is written  in  roman  letters.  The  word sawayaka also  seems  to  be  associated  with something  that  bubbles;  it  would  be  strange  to  say  a  phrase  like Sawayaka, teisuti, I feel  coke! ( ' R efreshing, Tasty,  I  Feel  [like  having  some  fruit]  Juice'). Perhaps  the  best  way  to  translate  this  slogan  might  be  something like ' Refreshing,  tasty,  I feel  like  drinking  a  Coke!',  or  T feel  like  part  of  the  Coke generation!'.  One  might  even  accept  'I feel  like  having  bubbles  of  Coke  inside of  my body!'  as a valid  translation.  Whatever  native  English  speakers  may  think, this  phrase  has  been  one  of  the  most  successful  in Japanese  advertising  history, and  appears  in  magazines  and  billboards  all  over Japan,  as  well  as  on  radio and  television. 14

## Treating  English  and Japanese  as if they were  the  same  language: The  mixing  of  English, katakana and  characters

The  presence  of various  writing  systems  in contemporary Japanese  has an historical  analogy.  Miller  (1967)  notes  that  during  the Heian  Period  (7941185),  when  the co-existence  of both  Chinese  and Japanese  became  wellestablished,  people  began  to treat and think  about  both  languages as if they were the same:

If a Chinese  text when  read  and  studied  sounded just  like a Japanese  text,  it was indeed  and  for  all  practical  purposes  a Japanese  text. And  if you  wrote Chinese  and  read Japanese, why not  go  one  step  further  and  write  Chinese even when  the intention  from  the beginning was to read  (i.e. actually to write in) Japanese.  . . . With  this, the  two writing systems  . . . became  once  and  for all inextricably  entangled  with  each  other,  as indeed  they remain  to this day. (Miller,  1967: 131)

It  could  be  argued  that  a  similar  p h e n o m e n o n  is occurring  in  the  twentyfirst  century  with Japanese  and  English.  Anyone  with  even  a  cursory  exposure to Japanese  written  works  of  any  kind  -  whether  they  be  books,  magazines, comics,  advertising  posters,  television  commercials,  or  whatever  -  will  soon realize  that  all  four  written  forms  are  present  together  and  intermix quite readily.  To  be  sure,  English  has  some  aspects  of  being  new,  chic,  and  Western. However,  the  presence  of  English  words  and  phrases  is hardly  due  to  prestige factors  alone.  Instead,  it  appears  that  English  has  become  another t ool available  for Japanese  people  to  use  in  the  language  of  their  daily  lives.  For example,  I  have  argued  throughout  this  book  that  informants  would  create new  'English'  elements  to  augment,  complement,  or  even  replace  Japanese elements  in  their  discourse. Whether  or not  this new creation  is really  'English', or s o m e t h i n g else,  is  academic  to  most  Japanese.  All n o m e n c l a t u r e considerations  aside,  these  are  language  forms  that  are  spoken  by Japanese, in Japanese,  for Japanese.  In  other  words,  English  has  become  another  set  of symbols  -  another  linguistic  resource  -  to  be  used  as Japanese  people  see fit,  j u s t  as  Chinese  and  the  written  Chinese  language  was  more t h a n a millennium  ago.

## Treating  English  and Japanese  as if they were  the  same  language: 'Reading-aids'  and  multigraphic  co-occurrences

This  sort  of  linguistic  fusion  is  certainly  not  new  in Japan.  Even  before t h e c u r r e n t  vogue  of  'reading-aid' katakana now  found in  pop  music and magazines, Japanese  book  publishers  often  created  English  versions  of  their titles  to  place  on  the  cover  of  their  books,  even  though  the  product  was  meant for  consumption  at home  only. One  result  of  this mixing -  whether  intended or  not  -  is  that  the  technical  and  psychological  differences  between  the  two languages  seem  to  be  muted.  Indeed,  the  identification  of  English  elements as Japanese  becomes  increasingly  reinforced  through  such  exposure.  And,  if t here  are  new  or  innovative  English  elements  that  some  people  may  not  know, these  pairings  quickly  take  care  of  any  items  that  are  not  transparent.  Some might  argue  that  anything  that  is still written  in  the  Western  alphabet  should obviously  be  considered  to  be  borrowed;  a gairaigo ( ' l o a n w o r d ' ) , t h e n , is anything  still  written  in rooma-ji ( ' r o m a n  letters').  As  shown  in  the  examples above,  there  are  problems  with  this  approach.

First,  such t h i n k i n g  assumes  that  the  only  medium of l i n g u i s t i c communication  is through  writing. Although  some  (e.g. Yotsukura,  1971)  have argued  that  most  loanwords  today  are  taken  into Japanese  by  eye  rather  than by ear,  there  is no  way to  know which  particular  orthographic  form  is  intended during  speech.  This  would,  of  course,  exclude  anything  as  a  loanword  unless it  was  written  down.

Second,  even  setting  aside  the  problem  of written  versus  spoken  language, t he Japanese  are  often  quite  nonchalant  about  which  orthography  they  may use  at  any  given  time.  As we  have  seen,  the Princess  Princess s ong  was  written as 'Diamonds* (in  unmodified r o m a n letters) as  often as  in t h e nativized katakana-syllabary version  of  this  English  loanword,  ^ ( - \ ^ &gt;  K (Daiyamondo). Is  o n e  a  l o a n w o r d ,  and  the  other  not?  Their  young Japanese  fans  seemed hardly  bothered  by  this  at  all.

Third,  sometimes  roman  letters  are  used  for  only  apparently  visual purposes.  This  is  often  the  case  for  items  of  apparel  or  personal  belongings, where  some  kind  of  English  word  or  phrase  is  almost  compulsory.  O n one sweatshirt  that  I  saw  (see  Figure  7.17),  for  instance,  there  were  five  words written  horizontally  with  their  middle  letter  in  large  bold  print: knotHole, seabOard, schooLhouse, prairie,  desCant. Vertically,  these  letters  then  spelled HOUC -  a  faddish  catch  phrase  which  was  popular  a  few  summers  ago.

The  case  may  also  sometimes  be  reversed:  a Japanese  person  may  write native  words  or  names  in rooma-ji to  create  some  kind  of artistic  effect  or  visual pun.  For  example,  for  the  logo  of  the  radical  rockers OTOKOGUMI (something like  'Men's  Club'),  they  wrote  their  name  in  their  own  very  idiosyncratic  way using  four kanji: ^ H B ? I §  . These  characters  (literally,  ^ ' men'; too H ' fight'; ko n? ' s u m m o n ' ;  and gumi '£§  gang') do  not  usually  occur  in  the  same compound,  although  they  could  be  theoretically  pronounced  together  as oTO-KO-GUMI. By using these characters  in this way,  the  rock  group  could  convey something  more  than just  their  name:  they are  a group  of guys called  together to  struggle  for,  perhaps,  their  music,  recognition,  or  even  the  acceptance  of t h e i r  lifestyle.  To  tell  the r e a d e r s how  this  c o m p o u n d is  s u p p o s e d to be pronounced,  their  name  is written  below  in  roman  letters:

## O  T  O  K O  G  UM  I

## m H i* IB

Another  example  can  be  seen  in  Figure  7.18,  the  sign  outside  a  restaurant in  Kanazawa.  Here,  the  speciality  of  the  house  is O-KONOMI-YAKI, a  kind famous Japanese  layered  pizza.  The  characters  and  syllabary  for  this  food's name  are  £ &gt; fcf h-^ , and,  as  seen  in  this  sign  here,  roman  letters  are  used beneath  each  glyph  to  indicate  its  intended  pronunciation.

of

The Japanese, then, seem to be experimenting with different  visual aspects of their language and writing systems, just as they did with Chinese a  thousand years ago. These  romanized  items or orthographic  play on words may not  be truly Japanese,  but  they are  hardly  English  anymore  either.

## American  views of English  in Japanese

Many Westerners, and  a surprising  number  of Japanese  themselves  (Stanlaw, 1995a), still believe  in  the  'copycat  mentality'  of  the Japanese.  The Japanese are  certainly  great  improvers,  they  say,  and  perhaps  are  even  competent engineers,  but  they  lack  spontaneity  and  their  culture  stifles  individual creativity. With all the technical advances made in Japan  in just the past  decade alone  - to  say nothing  of  the Japanese  'economic  miracle'  -  it is hard  to imagine  that  such  stereotypes  still  exist.  However,  many  people  mistake  a curiosity  and  fascination  with  Western  items  to  be  the  same  thing  as compulsion  or  fetish.  Thus,  for  them,  this  use  of  English  is just  one  more example of silly Japanese  imitation  of foreigners  and  their habits. They  could hardly be  more  wrong.

After  some study and  patience, when  they see a sign like Cleaning Relation Ship  Management. .  .  KEEP CLEAN LITE .  .  .  YOUR DRESS (see  Figure  7.19),  it  will make some sense to them. They will realize that there are graphic and  symbolic reasons  for  such  phrasing,  and  cultural  and  linguistic  motivations  for

Figure  7.19 Cleaning Relation  Ship  Management: A lesson  in  reading  'visual'Japanese

' b o r r o w i n g '  English  loanwords,  and  borrowing  them  in  this  fashion.  In  short, they  will  have  begun  to  learn  how  to  read  'visual  Japanese'.

## Cultures  high  and  low: English,  register,  and  script

Before  I  conclude  this  chapter,  I want  to  return  to  an  issue  that  was  brought up  in  Chapters  2  and  3  (as  I  think  the  more  nuanced  understanding  of  how Japanese  scripts  are  used  together  with  loanwords  -  which  I have  tried  to  give in  this  chapter  -  helps  address  it).  I  have  so  far  presented  data  on  the  use  of English  loanwords  in Japanese  found  in  advertising,  comic  books,  music,  and other  areas  of  'popular  culture'.  But  one  might  ask  at  this  point  the  logical question:  Do  English  loanwords  pervade  'high  culture'  as well?  The  answer,  I would  say,  is yes,  although  there  are  some  differences  in  style,  presentation, and  register  (e.g.  see  Katayama  [1982]  for  newspapers;  see Yoneda  [1982]  or Sugano  [1984a,  1984b]  for  broadcasting).  One  area  to  explore  is  the  various articles  and  editorials  occurring  in  newspapers.

## English in  newspaper editorials

In  the  early  1970s,  the Japanese  National  Language  Research  Institute  began a  series  of  studies  on  the  vocabulary  of Japanese  newspapers (Kokuritsu Kokugo  Kenkyuujo, 1971;  1972;  1973;  1974),  but  one of t h e earliest i n v e s t i g a t i o n s  devoted  only  to  the  use  of  English  loanwords  in  Japanese newspapers  was conducted  by Ozawa  in  1970  (Ozawa,  1970;  1976).  He  looked at  twenty  editions  of  the Yomiuri Shimbun, a  popular  national  daily,  in  February 1970,  and  retrieved  and  analysed  all  the  loanwords  that  appeared  in  every paper  (Ozawa,  1970).  He  claims  that  there  were  around  700  such  types  (i.e. different  loanwords,  ignoring  repeats),  although  his  tables  seem  to  give a  total number  closer  to  850. Apart  from  doing  the  usual  phonological,  syntactic,  and morphological  analysis,  he  also  made  a  semantic  classification  of  589  nouns i nto  some  18  types,  as  shown  in  Table  7.5.  It  shows  that  25.3  percent  of  these terms were  placed  in  a miscellaneous  catch-all  category,  suggesting  that  a  more robust  classification  would  have  been  useful.  Still,  he  found  that  17  percent of  the  loanwords  applied  to  the  home  (the  'Food'  and  'Domestic'  categories), about  12  percent  of  the  loanwords  were  'Technical'  terms,  and  10  percent referred  to  'Sports'. A brief  glance  at his  table  of analysed  words  (1970)  indeed shows  hundreds  of  expected  items  like apartment,  guitar,  democracy, whisky, and so  on.  Perhaps  his  list  could  be  thought of  a ' b a s i c '  English l o a n w o r d vocabulary  that  everyone  is  minimally  expected  to  know  (at  least  circa  thirty years  ago).

Iwasaki  (1994)  specifically  studied  newspaper  editorials  in  the Yomiuri Shimbun (rather  than  the  whole  paper  itself).  His  work,  too,  suggests  that 'typical'  loanwords  tend  to  be  the  norm  in  this  register.  He  examined  62 editorials  from  May and June  1992, and  classified  them  into  six  'semantic categories'.  Table  7.6  shows  these  six  divisions, with  editorials  on  domestic politics  being  the  most  abundant.  Iwasaki  also  found  that  there  were  198 English  loanwords  used  in  these writings,  or  3.19  per  editorial.  However,  as the middle columns in Table 7.6 indicate, there were differences  between  types of  categories.  For  example,  environmental  topics  used  7.33  loanwords  per editorial, while  international  politics used - surprisingly - only  1.62.

Taken  in  aggregate,  this  work  suggests  that  English  is  used rather infrequently  in Japanese  editorials. However, Iwasaki did not tell us how many total  words were  found  in  each  editorial;  this was important,  as three  words

per  case  could  be  a rather  large, or  rather  small,  proportion  of  the  total. My guess  is that  these Yomiuri editorials  were  their  short  commentaries,  usually running  around  100  to  200  words.  Secondly,  Iwasaki  (1994)  says  that  he intentionally  did not count  place  or  personal  names, weights  and  measures, or  currencies; more  importantly  he  did  not  tally 'acronyms  (e.g. NATO)  and initialisms  (e.g. CIS)'. As I have argued,  however, since such  terms play a very important  role  in  the  importation  of  English  into Japanese,  I  think  this methodological  convention  skews the frequencies  substantially  lower.

Iwasaki  also  discussed  his  data  in  terms  of  specific  words. Table  7.7,  for example,  presents  the  eleven  English  loanwords  - which  he  noted  were 'abstract'  concepts  (1994)  -  that  appeared  in  three  or  more  editorials.  In fact,  Iwasaki  believes  that most of  the  loanwords  he  examined  in  his  sample were abstract  nouns. Table  7.8 lists the  only twenty-one  English  loanwords  in the whole corpus that he thought  to be 'tangible' or  'concrete'. A few of  these concrete  nouns no doubt reflect  the small sample size and  the particular  issue of  the  day  being  discussed  (e.g.  the ozone hole containing chloroflurocarbons, trichloroethane, etc.).  But  others  are,  again,  the  usual  suspects  of  the  'basic' loanword vocabulary: rajio ('radio'), hoteru ('hotel'), manshon ('mansion',  or condominium-apartment),  or biru ('building').

## Newspaper editorials  and  advertising compared

Compared  to, for  example,  television  and  magazine  advertising,  the  English found  in  these  newspapers  does  seem  pretty  mundane. 15 For  example, Takashi  (1990)  examined  English  loanword  usage  in  some  500  television commercials and  400 print advertisements  in  1989. She collected 5,556 loans from  this  sample  (even  though  it  is a little  unusual  to  equate  the  instance of  a  television  advertisement  with  a  page  of  print  advertising).  This apparently  yields  an  average  of  6.05  loanwords  per  advertisement (5,556 words/918 advertisements), which  is about double  the  rate of 3.19 loans  per editorial  found  by  Iwasaki.  Takashi,  however,  argues  that  more  than  45 percent  of  these  terms  were  'special-effects-givers',  or  loanwords  designed to  'give  new  and  cosmopolitan  images  of  the  product'  or  service  being advertised  (1990: 330). Examples of this are sukin-kea ('skin  care'), puresutijjina ('prestigious'),  or herushii ('healthy').  There  was  little  difference in 'special-effects-giver' loanwords  in  advertising  targeting  either  males  or females  (p. 332),  and  she  thought  'the  penetration  of loanword  use  in  the advertisements  addressing  all age groups'  to be  quite  'remarkable'  (p. 338).

In contrast, unlike advertising, newspapers seem to use few technical  terms or  'lexical-gap  fillers'  (i.e. words  used  for  a proper  name,  place, or  imported item  like beddo ['bed']  or shawaa ['shower'] which  have  no  Japanese equivalent).  There  seem  to  be  no  correlation  between  the  function  of  a loanword  and  an  intended  audience.  Also,  'editorials  do  not  exploit  the considerable  variation  in  the  knowledge  of English  among Japanese,  because they are not aimed at a particular readership'  (Iwasaki, 1994: 269). If anything, the  loanwords  used  in  newspaper  editorials  co-exist  with Japanese  words 'having  practically  identical  denotation'  (p. 265).

## Do  newspapers use loanwords as extensively as other registers?

All  the  above  suggests  that  English  loanwords  in  'high  culture'  newspapers are  more  staid  than  in  the  colourful language  of  advertising  or  in  the vernacular  heard  on  the  street.  Or  perhaps  not. While  I grant  that  loanword usage  in  high  culture  is likely to be  slightly more  conservative, both  in  terms of  the  extent  of various  types and  frequency  of various  tokens, I believe  that loanwords do have  an  extensive  presence  here  as well, although  in ways  that might  not  be  apparent  at  first  glance.

My first reason for  this claim is sociolinguistic. Iwasaki himself  admits  that if English loanwords and Japanese  terms have the same referent  or  denotation, then  the loanwords actually do end up acting as special-effects-givers,  'providing some  special  effects  which  the  corresponding Japanese  words  do  not  have' (1994: 265). Thus, the native Japanese  term  and  the English loanword  are not

necessarily  synonymous,  interchangeable  with  each  other  depending  on  the certain  influence  of particular  usage variables  (e.g. topic being written  about, age  or  reputation  of  the  writer,  and  so on). This  subject  will be  explored  in more  detail  in  subsequent  chapters.

There  are  also  other  more  interesting  ways to  examine  how  loanwords  are used  in  newspapers  than  to just  make  to  tally  counts. 16 As we  have  seen  in this chapter,  there  are fascinating  connections  between Japanese  scripts,  the visual  image, and  semantic  content,  especially  in  the  context  of English.  For example, the use of acronyms in newspapers is extremely pervasive  (although some investigators like Iwasaki tend  to dismiss them). But the acronyms  often play critical  roles  in  newspaper  stories - and  especially  headlines.  In  2002, the acronym and kanji combination W ff (pronounced daburu hai) was  found everywhere  as it  referred  to  the  World (W) Cup (hai) soccer  tournament being  hosted  by Japan.  One  headline  told  of  the  IT /^USUIfr&amp;ffl (IT Baburu Sari Gentooki 'The  Harsh  [Winter]  Period  of IT After  the Bubble  [Has Burst]'). 17 We are  informed  parenthetically  in  the  story  that  IT  means tt$E &amp;ffi i (joohoo gijutsu, or  'Tnformation Technology').  Informants  tell  me  that often  these  headline  or story acronyms are non-transparent,  even for  people with  a  good  command  of  English.  (It  is little  consolation  to  them  when  I say that  this  is often  the  case  for  native  English  speakers  as well.)  However, people  know that these  things will be explained  to them  in  the  text. In  other words, the use of acronyms is intended  to attract the reader to the main  story.

Another example is found  in Figure 7.20. This page-one picture and  cover story is concerned with the merger between two of  Japan's major  airlines, Japan Airlines (Nihon Kookuu) and Japan  Air System (Nihon Eashisutemu) . 18

What  is interesting  about  the  headline  to  this  story is its use  of  proper names  and  acronyms.  Both Japan  Airlines  and Japan  Air  System  are  known by  their  initial  letters  to  their English names  (as  depicted  on  the  model airplanes  in  Figure  7.20).  Both  these  acronyms  can  be  pronounced  as words -jam and jasu respectively.  In  fact,  the  same  is true  for Japan's  other  major airlines  such  as All  Nippon  Airways.  These  variations  and  possibilities  are indicated  for  all  three  of  these  airlines  in  Table  7.9. That  is, Table  7.9  shows the  great  variety  of  rubrics  available  to  users  regarding  airline  names,  and Figure  7.20  demonstrates  how  such  potential  resources  can  be  put  into practice.

The  headline  in Figure  7.20 reads  BttJASJSgtt^ (NikkooJAS Keiei Toogoo, Japan Airlines and Nihon Air System  [To Form]  Business Partnership'),  using the/AS acronym  to  refer  to  Nihon  Air  System  and  BM (Nikkoo) to  refer  to Japan  Airlines.  By placing Japan  Air  System  in  roman  letters  and  using  the Japanese  nickname  in kanji for Japan  Airlines,  the  reader's  eye  seems  to  be

Figure 7.20 JAL and JAS Merger

<!-- image -->

drawn  to  the  word JAS. Perhaps  this  graphically  represents  the  author's  or editor's  own  surprise  that  the  substantially  smaller  company  would  be  able  to merge  with  the  much  larger  Japan  Airlines.  On t h e  next  page  of t h e newspaper,  when  more  details  of  the  transaction  are  given,  this  other  story's headline  is written  in  a  similar  fashion,  but  this  time  using  the  acronym JAL instead  of  the Japanese  characters  for Japan  Airlines: J  A L  · J  A  S  ^t'o'v Jam -  Jasu Toogoo e ('Towards  a JAL  and JAS  Merger').  The  effect  this  time  seems to  be  more  sober  and  analytical,  with  less  of  the  surprise  element  involved.

## Katakana as  colloquial  speech

Another  issue  we  need  to  consider  is  the  role  of katakana in  newspapers.  My c o l l e a g u e , t h e a n t h r o p o l o g i c a l l i n g u i s t  Nobuko  Adachi ( p e r s o n a l communication),  suggests  that katakana is  s o mething  different  from  what  it is usually  claimed  to  be.  Rather  than  being  a Japanese  italic  script  used  to  write foreign  names  or  places,  she  argues  that katakana has  really  lost  much  of  its ' f o r e i g n n e s s '  and  is  now  a  special  way  to  depict  in  writing  particular  spoken forms.  Words  written  in katakana, t h e n ,  r e p r e s e n t  colloquial  speech  styles r e n d e r e d  on  paper.  Rather  than  being just  marking the  foreign or  unusual, they  mark  playful  or  less  serious Japanese.

As  an  example,  consider  this  phrase  (also  found  in  the Asahi Shimbun): df+U^T do kirei (literally  meaning  'super-pretty'  in  normal Japanese,  using  no l oanwords  here). 19 T h e r e  are  several  ways  this might be  written  in  Japanese. We  should  first  note  that  as  there  is really  no kanji character  for do ('super'), Japanese  would  probably  use  the  character £S - which  is actually  pronounced choo -  and  write furigana ( t h e little hiragana r e a d i n g - a i d s mentioned previously)  beside  it, indicating  how the writer  intends  the  character  to be  read. Such  a  'normal'  script  using  a kanji character  (to stand  for  the word do, ' s u per', but  usually  pronounced choo otherwise)  and hiragana (for kirei, ' p r e t t y ' ) and little hiragana to  indicate  the  intended  pronunciation  of  the  character, do might  look  something  like  this ( t h e  J a p a n e s e is  on t h e left a n d t h e pronunciations  are  on  the  right):

| E   |         | do      |          |
|-----|---------|---------|----------|
| £g  | £ t l U | {choo}  | kirei    |
|     |         | 'super' | 'pretty' |

If  such  mental  gymnastics  were  not  enough,  there  are  several  other  ways to write  this phrase.  It might  also be  rendered  using  a combination  of katakana and hiragana, as  in  &lt;5£+l"f (with  the hiragana-lettered do and katakana word, kirei) or K#tlt^  (with  the katakana word do and  the hiragana word kirei). Using about  the  same  size  and  font  as  the  example just  given,  these  two  techniques of  writing  this  phrase  could  appear  as  follows  (I  have  numbered  them,  and given  an  indication  of  each  word's  orthography,  as  a  discussion  aid):

i. a *u-r 2. K #nu do kirei do kirei hiragana katakana katakana hiragana

In  these  last  two  cases,  it  is  not  simply  that  the katakana italics  is  the  marked form:  because  of  the  number  of  symbols  in  the  following  word, kirei -  which

is different  from  the way the  first word do is written  -  the  first  word do is  always marked  as special  and  noticeable.  Another  way of  saying  this  is  that  the  word do ( ' s u p e r ' )  focuses  on  the  reader  -  'me'  -  while  the  word kirei ('pretty') focuses  on  the  Other  (to use a post-modernist  gloss). Things written  in hiragana are  usually  more  natural  and  personal;  things  written  in katakana are often more  distant,  hard,  or  even  harsh.  The  question  is, then,  how  these  two  phrases -  both  using  words  written  in katakana -  perceived?  In  the  first  form df+ U-f  , with kirei written  in katakana And  do written  in hiragana, t here  is a  feeling of  mildness  and  sensitivity; do here  even  suggests  onomatopoeic expressions like dokin  (  E^h&gt; ) or doki-doki  (  Ei*E1* ) , t h e  s o u nds  of  the  beating  of  one's heart.  This,  combined  with  the  word kirei b e i n g  written  in katakana, implies that  the  women  (presumably)  is attractive  and  to  be  admired.  This  would  be the  form  that  one  would  want  to  use,  say, if one  wanted  to  sell  something  like a  car  or  a  colour  printer.  This  feeling  is more  striking  if we  consider  the  other way of  rendering  this  phrase:  K # t l O  (as  in  Number  2 above).  Here  the  word do is  written  in katakana, and  it  emphasizes  the  'superness'  of  the t e r m , implying  a sexual  or  sensual  connotation.  Of  course,  all  of  this  is very  contextspecific  and  conditional.  Different  words  with  different  ways  of  writing,  in different  situations  would  likely  suggest  different  analyses.

## Using English, English loanwords, and katakana for high culture

The  point  is, words  written  in katakana are not necessarily  marked  as  foreign, but  are Japanese  already.  As  we  have  seen  in  this  chapter, Japanese  people play  with  their  scripts  all  the  time,  in  various  ways.  These  things  combine  to give  newspapers  a  very  intriguing  look  when  reporting  or  commenting  on world  events,  using  a  mixture  of  orthographies,  loanwords,  and  acronyms. Figure  7.21  (p.  185),  a  r a n d o m  section  taken  from  the  editorial  page  of  the Asahi  Shimbun, shows  a  number  of  these  features. 20

First,  we  can  notice  that  on  the  right  side  we  see  the  heading  in  pure English opinion  @ news  project

written  vertically,  telling  us  that  this  is  the  editorial  section  (although  this  is probably  not  the  way The  Guardian or New  York Times would  phrase  things). The c e n t r e headline is  also i n t e r e s t i n g : :t"b"V £ £ £ £ X^ X + Z L - X Osama  sama-sama ekusukyuuzu (figuratively,  'Because  of  Osama,  We  Now  All Have  an  Excuse').  Here  we  see  the  name Osama and  the  English l o a n word 'excuse' written  in katakana. In  pure  English  we  see  the  phrase Osama  Excuse in  the  graphic.  However,  we  also  find  in hiragana the  words sama-sama. This needs  a  little  explanation.

First,  most  people  know  that Japanese  people  usually  use  the  suffix -san attached  to  a  personal  name  to  denote  respect  when  speaking  to  someone (e.g. Yamamoto-san, or  Ms Yamamoto).  The  suffix -sama is  similar,  but  is  much more  laudatory;  it  is  only  used  for  special  persons  or  particular  conventions (e.g. Yamamoto  Kumiko-sama, when  addressing  a  letter).  We  might  think  of -sama, t h e n ,  as  an  especially  elevated  form  or  Mr  or  Ms This  phrase  is  used  in the  standard  phrase o-kage-sama  de, ' t h a n k s  to  you',  or  'thanks  for  your  help'. O-kage means  support,  influence,  or  help,  and  adding -sama to  this  phrase literally  means  something  like  'Mr [or  Ms]  Helper'.  The de p a r t i c l e j u s t indicates  the  usage  of  something.  Thus, o-kage-sama ^literally  means  'Because of  [using]  you,  Honorable  Mr/Ms  Helper  . . .  [things  went  OK  for  me].'

Now,  if you  want  to  be  a  little  sarcastic,  you  can  repeat  the -sama suffix twice,  implying  not  only  that  the  recipient  is  not  worthy  of  so  much respect, but  also  that  his  or  her  actions  provide  you  with  an  excuse  for  something.  For example,  thanks  to  [Prime  Minister] Yjo'izuvai-sama-sama I  might  as  well  take that  vacation  to  Europe,  as  there  is no  sense  saving  money  in  such  a  deflating economy  under  his  administration's  management.  But  sarcasm  is  not  always necessarily  involved.  The -sama-sama t e r m  implies  a  sense  of  'reason  for' or ' e x p l a n a t i o n  of even  if  one  is not  trying  to  ridicule  someone.  It  can  even  be applied  to  inanimate  objects.  For  example,  in  the  1960s,  one  could  hear  that it  was Kankoo-sensoo-sama-sama da (' d u e t o ' [-sama-sama] t h e  ' Korean  War' [Kankoo-sensoo]) that Japan's  economy  grew  so  rapidly.

In  any  case,  in  Figure  7.21  there  is  an  obvious  intentional  play  on  words by  calling  Osama  bin  Laden  as Osama sama-sama. What  the  'Osama  Excuse' (i.e,  ' d u e  to  Osama' [Osama sama-sama] and  'excuse' [ekusukyuuzu]) in  this editorial  refers to  is  t h a t  now  everyone  has  someone  to  blame  for t h e i r problems  or  shortcomings.  The  reason  for  those  failed  economic  policies  of Koizumi's?  Osama,  of  course.  Thus,  according  to  the  editorial,  the ' Osama Excuse'  is  actually  a  godsend  for  government  officials  everywhere.

There  are  also  many  other  interesting  things  in  Figure  7.21. We  find various  acronyms  common  in  news  reporting  and  editorials:  NATO,  MGM,  or IMF.  These  are  often t r a n s l a t e d  i n t o  normal  Japanese,  as  in  'NATO (Kita TaiseiyooJooyaku  Kikoo)', or  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization.  In  the  sections of  the  two  editorials  depicted  in  Figure  7.21,  there  are  a  total  of  about  300 words  of  all  kinds. This  selection  does  not  seem  to  be  particularly  unusual  for t he Asahi's editorial  pages.  However,  a  great  many  of  the  words  -  about  75, or  a b o u t a  q u a r t e r  of  t h e  total  -  are  written  in katakana, and  this  is  an apparently  higher  number  than  the  one  given  by Iwasaki  previously.  It  is  true t h a t  if  we  exclude  the  proper  names,  place  names,  and  acronyms  -  as  did Iwasaki  -  the  number  falls  from  about  75 words  to  about  25,  or  to  about  8 or  9  percent  of  the  total  tokens.  Although  it  is impossible  to  exactly  compare this  figure  to  Iwasaki's,  this  estimate  seems  about  three  times  higher  than  his claim (assuming  editorials  of  approximately  equal  length).  Some  of  the

Figure 7.21 Osama's Excuse

<!-- image -->

common  English  words  (excluding  proper  nouns)  found  in  Figure  7.21  are tero ( t e r r o r i s m ) , terorisuto (terrorist), ekusukyuuzu (' e x c u s e ' ) , toppu ( ' t o p ' ) , bijinesu ('business'),  and resutoran ('restaurant').  Most  of  these  English  loans are  not  abstract  nouns,  but  concrete  objects  (again,  unlike  the  findings  of Iwasaki  in  1994).

We cannot  leave  this  topic  without  at  least  mentioning  one  final  issue:  the use  of  English  and katakana in  editorial  cartoons  and  other jokes.  Figure  7.22 shows one  such  example. 21 Israeli  Prime  Minister  Ariel  Sharon  is shown  talking to  Palestinian  Chairman  Yasser Arafat  on  top  of  an  overturned  broken  table saying, Mohaya,  giri-giri  no  dan-kai  daze ('This  is  already  the  last  step  for  you'). American  President  George  Bush  sits behind  Sharon  in  the  background.  The i ntriguing  element  is  the  overturned  table,  with  the  phrase Wa-hei  no teeburu ('the  peace table'or process)  also written  upside  down.  The  English  loanword table -  also written  this way -  is very  striking  and  conspicuous,  contributing to  the  cartoon's  total effect.

## The  verdict: Loanwords  on a  higher  plane

There is little doubt that advertisers and pop singers are likely to use loanwords and  fresh  expressions - breaking  phonological,  morphological,  syntactic  or pragmatic rules - to be purposefully  eye-catching and intriguing. The  studies by Ozawa,  Iwasaki, and  others  suggest  that  it is indeed  true  that  newspaper articles  -  especially  editorials  -  use  rather  a  drab  English  loanword  fare compared  to these experimentalists and  innovators. However, I am  not  totally convinced  that the actual numbers  of English  loanwords are lower than  those in  other  printed  registers, but  there  appears  to be at least some evidence  that newspaper columnists are being less adventurous - English loanword-wise than,  say,  advertising  copywriters.  However,  as  the  examples  in  the  above sections  have shown, I believe, in newspapers  English, loanwords,  romanizedJapanese,  and  orthography  are  all used  in very original  and  prominent  - if not ostentatious - ways. The verdict would  therefore  seem  to be that there is no  such  thing  as a  plain,  conservative,  or  'normal'  loanword;  each  is a  frog waiting  to be  kissed.

## Conclusion

English  is hardly  a  true  'second  language'  for  even  a significant  minority  of the Japanese  people.  Nor  does  it  have  any  authorized  status,  as  French  in

Canada,  in  spite  of  some  quasi-official  sanctions  supporting  it.  However, English  appears in various guises in the daily linguistic lives of every Japanese, be  it  code-switching  and  mixing,  true  bilingualism,  or  the  use  of  loanwords and  phrases.

It  is  obvious  that  communications  technology  and  improvements  in transportation  have  made  the  modern  world  extraordinarily  complex  and remarkably  small. Tokyo  and  Osaka  are  now world  financial  and  industrial centres, as well as major  influences  in  a number  of cultural  areas, such  art  or fashion. Japanese  graphic  arts, films,  television  programmes  and  commercials rank among the best in the world. Thousands of magazines and comics  appear every week and  are  read  by a large  audience. There  is little  doubt  about  the high degree of visual literacy and sophistication  of the average Japanese  citizen.

While  Westerners  have  long  taken  pleasure  in  reading  this  'empire  of signs', Japanese  have  delighted  in  looking  at  the  West with  a semiotic  eye  as well.  'Reading'  the West has long been  a hobby and  professional  occupation for  many Japanese  for  well  over  a  century.  What  was  found  useful and aesthetically  pleasing was brought  in. After  certain  initiations, and  other  rites of  passage,  crystals  and  impressions  of  these  foreign  things  coalesced  and remained.  And  as with  crystals  everywhere,  patterns  continue  to  grow  in beautiful,  complicated,  and  often  unpredictable  ways.

## Introduction

It  was strange  to  see,  but  there  it was, clearly  outlined  in  red  on  the  plastic dish  on  my friend's  breakfast  table. 1 In  the  letters  of  the katakana syllabary the  writing  system  that  the Japanese  use  to  write  foreign  words  - was  the appetizing  name Fatto Supureddo, 'Fat  Spread'. 2 This  butter  substitute  was ironically named, as it was actually a very healthy, low calorie, margarine  made only of  the  very best  'vegetable  oil' (shokubutsu yushi) with  almost  no  salt  or other debilitating substances. It was a special brand  distributed by a nationwide housewives  co-op (Tsukishima  Shokuhin  Koogyoo, Tokyo),  so  the  quality  was supposed  to  be  outstanding.  Yet,  I  somehow  could  not  get  the  image  of spreading white condensed  lard  on  my toast out of my mind.

Most people are aware that many new foods have been brought into Japan. For  example, Makudonarudo hamburgers  are  everywhere,  even  in  outlying areas. There  are  also numerous American  foods  like Tekusasu Suteeki ('Texas Steaks'), Aisu ('ice-cream'),  and FuraidoPoteto (Trench fries'); even Sunoo Booru ('snow  cones')  have  come  to Japan.  However,  in  this chapter  I am  not  going to  look  at  these  obviously  imported  foods,  but  instead  I will  focus  on  some local kinds. These  home-grown  varieties that I want to look at have  borrowed English  names, although  most often  not  an American  taste.

To  many  Westerners, Japanese  food  is  stereotypically  associated  with curious  ingredients,  strange  preparations  (or  even  lack  thereof),  and  arcane culinary  rituals.  I believe,  however,  that  one  of  the  most  exotic  aspects  of Japanese  cuisine  may be  the  myriad  English  loanwords  used  in  most  of  the packaged  foods,  snacks,  and  prepared  fare  found  in  the  typical  Japanese grocery  store.

In  this  chapter  I will  examine,  semiotically  and  sociolinguistically,  the packaging  of  over  one  hundred  of  these Japanese  prepared  foods.  I will examine  four  ways English  loanwords  are  used  in  these Japanese  processed foods,  and  then  look  at half  a dozen  or  so communicative  strategies  that  are

used  in Japanese  food  packaging,  including  some of the  elements  of  graphic design.  I will  then  discuss  how  these  loanwords  have  actually  contributed  to the  creation  of  new foods  in Japan.

English product names, phonetically nativized and written in the Japanese katakana syllabary, provide interesting visual aromas for fare  that is often  rather mundane. English Catch Phrases in roman letters  (as in Look Strawberry Chocolate) describing the enclosed foods  can add an intriguing visual spice. Western-style foods,  naturally,  are  often  prone  to be  associated  with  loanwords  (as in Hello Panda [cream-filled  biscuits], China Marble [jaw-breakers],  or Kiss Mint  For Etiquette [chewing gum  to eliminate  bad  breath]).

These foods are most often  designed in Japan, for Japanese  tastes. Candies with Air In  Chocolate, or  hot  horseradish-spiced  peas  that  are  a Happy Present From The Earth are  not  poor  attempts  to mimic English  brand  names.  Instead, I argue  that what  is occurring  is a synaesthesia  of eye and  ear,  and  sight  and taste.  This  makes  the  native  food  more  intriguing,  the  borrowed  label  more domestic, and  the  consumer  more  sated.

## Western  words  and  Eastern  foods

As I have  pointed  out  in  previous  chapters,  English  loanwords  in Japan  are ubiquitous. Most Japanese  these days would be hard  pressed  to carry on  even the most rudimentary conversation without them. Loanwords may account  for up  to  5  to  10 percent  of  the  daily vocabulary,  and  the  vast majority  of  these are  from  English. Thus, it is not  too  surprising  that  processed  and  packaged foods  use  them  as well.

However,  it  should  also  be  recalled  that  the  term  'loanword'  is  rather misleading,  as nothing  is ever  really  taken,  nor  is anything  ever  given  back. That  is, most  of  these  English-like vocabulary  items  that we find  are  made  in Japan, for Japanese  purposes. Even setting phonological  problems aside, most Americans find  it difficult  to discern  the meaning of 'virgin road'  (see  Chapter 2),  'silver  seat'  (see  Chapter  7),  or  any  of  the  latest Japanese  rock  and  roll slang.

Even  when  actual  products  become  literally  taken  in,  an  interesting metamorphosis also occurs. For example, while the food  'pizza' may have  been inspired  by  Chicago  or  New York  restaurants,  no  American  could  have predicted  that  in  a very famous  Kyoto pizza parlour  a  'Manhattan  Mix'  pizza would include salami, onions, mushrooms, and corn and cuttlefish  as toppings. We would  therefore  expect  that  most  of  these  so-called  loanwords  will  be applied  to foods that are often  only distantly related to things found  in America or  Europe.

## Functions  of English  loanwords  in Japanese  foods

English  loanwords  can  often  be  used  by Japanese  marketers,  nutritionists,  or food  scientists to emphasize  certain  aspects of a food.  I think  there are at least four such functions  where English loanwords often  play critical roles: (1)  acting as food  descriptors;  (2)  giving food  instructions;  (3)  giving food  ingredients and value; and  (4)  presenting  a product's  history. I will now address each  one individually.

## English  loanwords can be used to tell  what  the food  is

English  loanwords  are  often  used  to make  descriptions  of the food,  or  to  tell exactly what  the  food  is. For  example, Dorai Aisu ('Dry  Ice')  is a fruit  candy -  'orange',  'lemon',  and  'green  apple'  -  with  a  hard  outside  shell  for 'freshness'  enclosing  a  'dry ice powder'  for  flavour.  (It should  be  mentioned here  that  term kyandee or kyandii or  ['candy']  in Japanese  is not  so  inclusive as  in  English.  It  usually  only  refers  to  hard  candy,  and  not  necessarily chocolates.)  The Meiji Company's Strawberry Parfait is a 'new type of chocolate' having a strawberry and  cream  centre.

Figure 8.1 Dorai Aisu: The fruit  candy

Sometimes,  these  descriptions  are  more  metaphorical  than t r a n s p a r e n t . For  instance, Flower's  Kiss  Candy has  individually  wrapped  pieces  of  milk Sumomo  (damson  plum)  in  the  following  flavours:  rose,  apricot  blossom,  and double  cherry  blossom.  The  emphasis  is on  creating  taste  that  approximates t h e  scent  of  the  flower  rather  than  the  taste  of  a  fruit.

English loanwords can  be used  to  indicate exactly what it  is  you  are  supposed  to do  with this food

An  example  of  this  is seen  in  one  of  the  most  interesting Japanese  packaged foods, Onepackun Family. This  is  a  collection (family') of  individual ( 'one') bites  or  packets  ( packun ' ) of  nuts,  roasted  peas, and  litde  rice  crackers. Packun probably  shares  an  etymology  with  the  name  Pac-Man  -  perhaps  the  most famous  arcade  and  computer  game  of the  twentieth  century. Paku is a Japanese children's  onomatopoeic  word  indicating  the  sound  of  biting  something  (as in paku  paku tabetal, T ate,  chomped  it down,  [like  a pig]!'). Names  like Cashew Nuts or Wasabi  Green are  given  in  roman  letters  on  these  individual  packets. On  the  back,  there  is  a  description  in  English  (not Japanese) t e l l i n g t h e purchaser  that  this  product  is an  assortment  of

.  .  . bite-sized  packs  of  different  snacks  made  with  selected materials. This, not  only accompanied  with beer  &amp; sake,  but a  good  partner  of outdoor,  and  a great  relish  of  children for  its fresh  taste:

eat  soon  when  opened, keep away from  direct  sunlight, keep  cool thanks

However,  it  is  interesting  that  one Japanese  word  packun (or /^y&amp;&gt;) -actually  says  almost  everything  this  English  paragraph  does.  If  there  is  any question  about  what  this  food  is, or  how  one  is supposed  to  eat  it,  the  above detailed  explanation  will  more  than suffice.

Another  example  of  these  English  loanword  instructions  can  be  found  in t h e  series  of KissMint chewing  gums  produced  by  Glico. KissMint For  Driver Cherry Mint has  the  following  properties  (again,  all are written  in  pure  English):

The fragrant  mint,  natural  caffeine,  and  delightful  cherry aroma wake you up  and  keep you alert yet relaxed.  The perfect  treat for  drivers, students  and  workers  who must work hour  after  hour.

## Those  who  use KissMint For Etiquette  Apple  Mint will

Be up  on  your  etiquette! The  crisp  clean  apple  fragrance keeps your breath  always fresh  and  clean.  Perfect  for dates and  important  interviews.

## KissMint  for  Elegance Jasmine  Mint has:

The  fragrance  that  moves around  you. With  the  refreshing harmony of jasmine  and  vitamin. Take with you for  dates and  get-together.

## KissMint  for  Relax  Forest Fragrance has  a  different  kind  of  appeal

The  natural  taste  is like  a fresh  forest  breeze.  Perfect for  a break  after  work  or  study. With  chlorophyll  and natural  flavourings.

## KissMint  for  Refresh  Litchi  &amp;  Lemon has  the  following  properties:

A delicate  blend  of lemon  and  litchi flavours  is  enhanced by chondrotin  for  a dazzling taste. It's good  for refreshing  mind  and  body.

In  a  sense,  all  these  explanations  are  superfluous,  as the  names  of  the  products seem  fairly  self-explanatory  to Japanese.  Thus,  in  terms  of  information,  much of  this  is  package  design,  giving  different  feelings  towards  the  food (perhaps new  or  Western).

English loanwords can  be used  to emphasize quality or tell  of  the foods ingredients

An  example  of  this  is  seen  in  the  packaging  of  Bonchi's Mentaiko Arare rice crackers  where  it  is  stated  that Fresh Is  Best, a n d that

Bonchi  always present you fresh  goods by excellent productivity  and  strict quality  control

Figure 8.3 Mentaiko arare

<!-- image -->

Likewise,  purchasers  of  Hosoda's Kaki  No  Tane  (Rice  Crackers) are  warned  that these  are Extra  Hot by  the  label  on  the  bottom.

Buyers  of Kanro's Koohii  Sakan/Coffee Candy are  told  in  English  that t h e different  flavours  are Blue  Mountain, Mocha and Kilimanjaro.

English loanwords  can  be used to indicate  what a product  consists of  and  its origins or history

The  packaging  often  touts  the  many  beneficial  properties  of  the  enclosed product.  Oddly  enough,  detailed  histories  and  descriptions  of  many  uniquely Japanese'  packaged  snacks  can  be  found  in  English.  For  example, Soramame Monogatari/Soramame Story (' The  Broad  Bean  Story')  tells  us  that  (in  pure English):

Broad  beans  mainly consist of starch  and  protein  and  also contain  plentiful  Vitamin  Bl  and  Vitamin  C and  other minerals  such  as Calcium. These  broad  beans  contain particularly  more Vitamin  B2. Vitamin  B2 has an  effect on  the  growth  hormone.  Its savory taste  makes it  the most delicious  broad  beans.

Figure 8.4 The Broad Bean Story

<!-- image -->

## Another  product, Beano (roasted  green  peas),  does  a  similar  thing  for  beans and  peas  (once  more,  in  English):

Green  peas are  the  product  of young immature  peas.  The utilization  value  of  the  immature  green  pea  is quite  high. The  main  elements  of the  pea  are  protein  and  carbohydrates. There  are  also a lot  of vitamins  such  as Bl,  B2, B3, and  C inside. The  taste  of  the  green  pea  is the  flavor  of  early summer,  a taste  that you  can  look forward  to. According  to experts  on  the  subject,  the varieties  of vitamins  and  high fiber  found  in  green  peas help  the  body's metabolism,  aids in  slowing down  the  aging process, and  helps  keep  skin  young.

## The  communicative  strategies  of English  loanword  usage  in Japanese  foods

English  loanwords  can  be  used  in  various  ways  to  communicate information to  the  consumer.  Moreover,  English  loanwords  can  also  be  used  in  strategic ways  to  make  appeals  to  potential  customers.  I  believe  there  are  at  least  five such  communicative  strategies:  (1)  using  English  loanwords  to  make  an  appeal to  a  certain  image  or  a  customer  concern  (such  as  health  or  sophistication); (2)  using  English  loanwords  in  face  of  new  or  ambiguous  flavours  or  tastes; (3)  using  English  loanwords  to  make  analogies  between  new  foods  and  other more  well-known  foods;  (4)  using  English  loanwords  as  alternative  lexemes to  cover  similar,  although  not  synonymous,  semantic  ranges,  and  (5) using English  loanwords  to  represent  a  food  in  a  new  way.

English loanwords  can  be used  to make  appeals  to a  certain  kind of i meeji ('image') that a  consumer  might want to  be associated with

## Fashion

For  example, Jun Kajuu 100  Mix ('Pure  Fruit Juice  100  Mix')  is Fashionable Candy consisting  of  'Fresh  grape', ' F r e s h  peach',  and ' F r e s h  apple'.  A description  in  English  says  that:

This  peach  candy is including  a lot of peach  fresh  juice which was plucked  freshly.  This grape  candy is  including high  quality grape  fresh juice  harvested  in  the  west coast  U.S.A. We can  say this is almost  raw grape.  This apple  candy  including  fresh juice  taken  from  selected apple  born  in Aomori. We can  say it is almost  raw apple.

Figure 8.5 jun  Kajuu 100 Mix

<!-- image -->

Not only is the  candy said  to be  fresh  and  fashionable,  the  taste  is also  supposed to  be  p u r e  concentrate  coming  from  prestigious  places  like  California or Aomori. Aomori  is famous  in Japan  for  the  delicious  apples  this  northern  area produces.

## Health  and  diet

Packaged  foods  that  emphasize  health  or  nutrition  almost  always  make  their claims  using  English  or  English  loanwords.  For  example, Isofiber -Daietarii Aisofaibaa Pain ('Pineapple  Dietary Isofiber) and Faibaain 20 ('Fiberine 20') are  both  high-fiber  candies  which  promise  good,  if not  to  say,  regular,  health. In  English,  it  is  said  that Oliga  CC (from  Calpis):

revitalizes  the  Bifidobacterium  in your  intestines  and also helps  to  maintain  a proper  balance  in your  digestive processes. In  addition,  a piece  of this candy has as  much vitamin  C as two lemons. Therefore,  it not  only tastes  good, but  is also very  healthy.

Potential  calcium  deficiencies  can  be  alleviated  by  consuming  a  number of  snacks. Hokkaido milk  soft  candies  are  fortified  with  calcium  and  are ' n o t t oo  sticky'. The  Calcium  Black  Cream Sandwich can  be  used 'to  build  and  keep a healthy  body -from children  to aged  people'.

As  mentioned  above,  there  are  few  'diet'  foods  or  drinks per  se in Japan. Instead  of  'Diet  Coke',  there  is 'Coca  Cola  Light\ (Actually,  some  bottles  of American-style  'Diet  Coke'  can  now be  found  in  a few  places  in Japan.) Lightjoy Chocolate is a  candy  bar  for  those  addicts  who  want  a full-flavoured cream-filled interior  but  need  to  be  conscious  of  their  calories.  However,  it should  be  noted t h a t  this  is  changing.  Until  recently, Japanese  people  were  hesitant  to  drink ' diet'  drinks  or  eat  'diet'  foods  in  public,  as  this was an  obvious  admission  that T  am  fat  and  I  need  to  consume  this  kind  of  stuff.  Now,  however,  skinny Hollywood  movies  stars  and  health-conscious  athletes  are  seen  holding  diet drinks.  To  eat  and  drink  diet  foods  has  started  to  be  seen  as something  smart: I  a m avoiding becoming  fat, just  like  all  those  people  on  the Californian beaches.  The  public  stigma  seems  to  be  eroding.

A final  example  is from  Calpis's Air/Ea citrus  soft  drink.  These  days  people have  become  more  aware  of  how  unhealthy  many  cola  drinks  can  be.  They

Figure 8.6 Coca Cola Light

<!-- image -->

are  often  full  of calories,  caffeine,  and many  other  unnecessary  or  harmful ingredients. Air does  not sound  like  such  a soft  drink,  and its name  certainly implies  a  light  a n d carefree  beverage,  perhaps  even  more  than  something merely  'light'.

## Children's  foods

It  is very  c o m m o n  for children's  snacks  to use American  cartoon characters or  superheroes  in their  packaging.  For example, Packn Cho ( chocolate  cream packed  inside  a cookie)  uses  Disneyland  figures  such  as Mickey  Mouse and Donald  Duck with  English  titles on their  boxes. Several  children's  cookie  boxes even  actually  try and expose  them  to English.  For example,  Meiji's Autoland Printed  Biscuits does  not only  have  English  names  printed  on the drawings of t he  cookies,  on the back  of the  box there  is also  a glossary  of the  twenty-four illustrated  vehicles  inside.  Ginbis's Tabekko Doobutsu  Animal Shaped  Biscuits does a  similar  thing  with  English  animal  names.

Figure  8.7 Meiji's Autoland  Printed  Biscuits (front  and back)

<!-- image -->

English loanwords are often  chosen in  the face  of uncertainty or ambiguity

We  find  extensive  use of English  loanwords  when  it is difficult  to find  an appropriate  word  in  standard  Japanese.  However,  English  loanwords  are especially  useful  in describing  new  textures  or flavours,  or new  kinds  of foods.

An  example  of  this  can  be  seen  in  the  name  for  Morinaga's Hi-SOFT strawberry  milk  candies.  In  both  roman  letters  and katakana t e r m s like 'strawberry  milk' or ichigo  to miruku (strawberry  and  milk)  are  used.  This  candy is  a  kind  of  creamy  strawberry  caramel.  What  other  words  could  be  used  to describe  the  unique  taste  of  these  intensely-flavoured t e n d e r strawberry creams,  other  than  the  loan  creation Hi-SOFT} As  the  phrase  on  the  box  says (in  English):

The  delightful  harmony  of fresh  strawberry and  smooth milk gives a mouth  watering  treat.

There  are  many  other  such  examples.  One  last  case  comes  from Purin Ame (' P u d d i n g  Candy').  This  candy  consists  of  a  chocolate  centre  surrounded  by a  'custard  pudding'  outside  and  covered  with  'caramel  syrup'.

Figure 8.8 Hi-Soft Candy

<!-- image -->

English loanwords can  be used  to draw analogies or make  metonymic connections to  other foods or culinary styles

An  example  of  this  is found  in  the  several  efforts  to  convert  the  Japanese popular  soft  drink Lamune Soda i n t o  candy  form.  Both  Kanro  and  Shinozaki corporations  have  made  such  attempts, as Ramune-bin candy and Ramune (Soda) Candy respectively.  Both  products  claim  to have  captured  the  carbonated  feel and  tart  taste  of  the  original  soft  drink,  using  actual Lamune powder  or  fresh wrapping.

Another  example  can  be  found  in  Bourbon's Eburi Baagaa ('Every Burger').  This  time,  the  connection  is not  made  between  a  snack  and  some particular  brand  name.  Instead,  the  association  is tied  to a  type  of  American food, t h e  o n e  stereotypically  most  popular: Every Burgers are  bite-sized miniature  hamburgers  made  of a  'semi-sweet'  chocolate  patty  covered  with ' c r e a m '  as cheese,  and  topped  with  a  'biscuit'  sesame  seed  bun. Although  they may  not taste  like  miniature  Big Mac's,  the  connections  between  these  pieces of  candy  and  hamburgers  are intentional  and  obvious.

Figure 8.9a Every Burger (front)

English loanwords  can  be used as alternative vocabulary items,  or else cover  different semantic ranges

A  perennial  question  in  language-contact  and  language-borrowing  situations is  to  what  extent  the  old  indigenous  lexemes  and  new  borrowed  items  overlap in  semantic  space  (Allen,  1986a,  1986b).  I  have  argued  (Stanlaw,  1987a)  that in  many  linguistic  domains  in Japan,  such  as colour  terminology  (see  Chapter 9)  or  numbers,  the  English  loanwords  and  native Japanese  terms  label  different referents.  For  instance, reddo is not  a  synonym  for oka (' r e d ' ) ,  nor wan for ichi (' o n e ' ) .  I  believe  similar  things  may  be  occurring  in  the  domain  of foods.  That is,  t h e r e  may  be  similarities  -  to  be  sure  -  between  the  semantics  of  native Japanese  terms  and  English  loanwords,  but  they  are  not  synonymous,  and  do not  mean  exactly  the  same  thing.

For  example,  almost  all informants  told  me  that  they knew  that  the  English loanword sutoroberii ('strawberry')  was ichigo in native Japanese,  and  that appuru ('apple')  was ringo. Most  also  felt  that 'strawberry or 'sutoroberii were  the  more appropriate  names  for  most  of  the  packaged  foods  that  were  used  in t h e sample  I  examined.  When  the  non-loanword (ichigo) was  used,  it  was  always used  along  with  some  unusual  graphics  as  in  this  example  of Kuriimu Ichigo (' Cream  Strawberry')  candies,  with  the Japanese  re-written  in  English  and roman  letters just  below  it. This seems  to  make  more  of an  appeal  to  familiarity (strawberries)  than  to  the  newness  or  uniqueness  of  the  food.

Figure 8.10 Cream Strawberry

<!-- image -->

English loanwords can  be used  in  the  re-presentation of  other Japanese foods or styles

English  loanwords  can  be  used  to  offer  potential  buyers  certain  food  genres or  items  in  reconstituted  forms.  This  is especially  prevalent  in  the  repackaging (i.e.,  the ' r e - p r e s e n t a t i o n ' ) of  some  traditional Japanese  snacks  like o-sembei ('rice  crackers').  For  example,  the  package  of Nice  Ecomomy  Ikappe ('Nice Economy  Potato  Crackers')  tells us  that  this  snack  is  ' reasonable price and quality goods'. Thus,  this  traditional  snack  has  now  become  a  good  buy  and  wise shopping  choice.

Figure 8.11 Nice Economy Potato  Crackers

<!-- image -->

Another  example  of  how  traditional  foods  can  be  transformed  into  some other  kind  of  entity  is seen  in  the  packaging  of Azuki Vegetable Snack. T h e  cover tells  us  in  English  the  many  virtues  of  the azuki  (red-brown) bean:

Red-brown  beans are  one  of the  important Japanese traditional  provisions  and  its agricultural  distribution  is found  in  an  historical Japanese  chronicle  Kojiki.  Red-brown beans consist of protein  containing  sufficient  vitamin  B which  helps  the  recovery  of fatigue  and  beautifies the  skin. . . .

In  this way, this old Japanese  food (azuki) is being put into a modern  package ( Vegetable  Snack) ,  while  at  the  same  time  the  English  is used  to  make  the  reconnection  back to the past again  (e.g., in telling the story of how these  beans were  known  back  to  the  start  of recorded  history).

A similar  process  is  found  in  the  example  of Adzuki  Candy Mix. This product  consists of three varieties of azuki (red-bean)  confectioneries: miruku azuki ('milk  red-beans'), matcha azuki ('powdered  green-tea-flavoured  redbeans'),  and  plain azuki. The  package  tells us  that  in  each  case  the  red-bean centres  are  surrounded  by these  different  flavoured  hard  candies.

## Graphic  design  aspects  of Japanese  food  packaging: Rooma-ji, katakana, and hiragana writings

Having a variety of orthographies  at  their  disposal  - as we have  seen  in  the Appendix  -Japanese  people  can  often  do  interesting  things  in  advertising and  graphic  design.  These  different  writing  systems  can  transmit  several messages - both verbally and visually - at the same  time, and  thus serve as signifiers  with  a multiplicity  of  signifieds.

An  example  of this  kind  of graphic  word  play can  be  seen  in  the  candy China Marble. 'China  marbles'  are  rock-candies  shaped  into  little  balls.  They are  similar  to American  jaw-breakers',  although  they are  larger  and  harder, and  sweet  rather t h a n  sour.  The  name  on  the  package  uses t h r e e orthographies.  On  top  is China Marble in  roman  letters,  with  the  Japanese name, phonologically nativized [chaina maaburu] below. However, the Japanese name  is not  written  completely  in katakana, as would  be  expected  for  these kinds of sweets. The word  'China'  is neither  in  the katakana syllabary used  for foreign  terms  nor  in kanji characters.  Instead,  it  is written  in hiragana, the syllabary used  for  indigenous Japanese  vocabulary.

Japanese  people  seem  to  immediately  notice  the  three different orthographic  systems being used for  this food.  The  interesting question  here is: Why is the form  of writing used for  the word  'China'  in this case? It is likely that  the hiragana form  somehow seems more  approachable.  Informants  told me  that  if  'China'  is written  in hiragana, people  would  not  confuse  it  with porcelain  (or even the country). It also reminds  them  of  Japanese  diminutive expressions, such  as 'chitchat (a children's way of saying 'chiisai ['small']).

Thus,  what  the  manufacturer  may  be  trying  to  do  is  convey  several messages simultaneously: this candy is new and  interesting because it is chinalike in  that  it  is round  and  hard,  and  of  similar  colour  as Chinese  ceramics. However,  it is not really  made  of  glass, and  is certainly  small  enough  to  be edible, and  is actually a quite dainty and sweet food.  Using the different  scripts allows the  consumer  to understand  these visual analogies  more  easily.

Figure 8.12 China Marble

<!-- image -->

Another  example  of  graphic  word  play  is seen  in  foods  where  names  or description  are  given  in  actual Japanese,  but  written  in  roman  letters.  One instance  is of  the Ramune Kyandi (a  hard  candy  based  on  the  popular Lamune Japanese  soft  drink)  which  we  have  seen  before. 3 They  describe  their  product in  the  following  way,  using  roman  letters:

Ramune-bin ga kawaii candy ni  nacchai mashita. Shuwatto oishii ramune-powder iri  dayo.

(Bottles  of Lamune have  now become  cute  [little bottle-shaped]  candies, and  there  is real  bubbly fresh  delicious Lamune powder inside  them!)

They  also  give  a  sales  pitch  on  the  bottom  of  the  package,  this  time  using  all t h r e e  orthographies:

oishisa appu new

(a new better  taste; or  a new product  with a better  taste)

The  reason  why these Japanese  sentences  are  given  in rooma-ji might  again be  that  the  manufacturer  intends  to  say several  things  at  the  same  time.  Since

this  is  a new kind  of  food,  they  want  to  convey  actual  information  about  the product.  Thus,  it  is  indeed  described  -  not  in  English  -  but  in ' p u r e ' Japanese.  However,  as it still is some  new kind  of food,  purely  old-style Japanese writing  would  be  inappropriate.  The  manufacturer  therefore  makes  similar kinds  of  linguistic  and  orthographic  puns  that Japanese  people  have  been doing  with  writing  systems  ever  since  the  time  of  the Man  yooshu.

The  use  of  English loanwords in  the  creation of  new  foods and  products: Which came first, the  candy or  the loanword?

There  is no  doubt  that  English  loanwords  are  intimately  connected  with  new foods  and  new  food  packaging  styles  in Japan.  It  is  not  always  clear,  however, if  t h e  English  loanwords  are  used  to  name  a  newly-developed  food,  or  if  an English  loanword  suggests  the  development  of  a  new  food  in  the  first  place. For  example,  the  fresh  apple  candies of fun Kajuu  Fresh Apple ('Pure  Fruit Juice Fresh  Apple')  are  described  in  English  as  follows:

This  candy is including  fresh juice  taken  from  selected apples  born  in  AOMORI. We can  say it is almost  raw apple.

In  other  words,  it is claimed  that  this  candy  is not  being  made  from  the  apples themselves, but  from  the juice of  these  apples.  In  a  sense,  it is like  frozen  applej u i c e  c o n c e n t r a t e  b e i n g  reconstituted  as  a  piece  of  candy.  Perhaps  the  English did  not  inspire  the  new  confectionery,  but  it  certainly  took  a  loanword  to  give it  a  n a m e  after  it  was  invented.  We  should  notice,  too,  that  the  description  of Jun  Kajuu 100  Mix on  pp.  196-7 had  a similar  explanation  (most  likely  because that  product  also  included  some  of  these fresh  apples). That  is, we  see  English being  used i n t h e  propagation of a  f o o d series,  which I  will discuss momentarily.

In  a  similar  way, Cuby  Rop  Fruits  Candy is  an  interesting  piece  of  food engineering.  Little  cubes  of  seven  different  flavours  -  pineapple,  melon (cantaloupe),  honey-lemon,  grapefruit,  strawberry,  peach,  and  grape  -  are paired  together  in  different  combinations  as a single piece  of candy  (e.g.,  grape and  peach;  strawberry  and  pineapple,  etc.). Presumably,  one  could  place  these pieces  end  to  end  to  make  a long  rope,  or  try and  solve  a Rubik's  Cube  puzzle. It  is  likely  that  t h e  name  comes  from  a  combination  of Cubic plus Drop (following  the  well-known  Japanese  penchant  for  linguistic  function and recombination  of words).  In  any  case, using  English  loanwords  for  this  candy seems  somehow  eminently  appropriate.

Figure 8.13 Jun Kajuu Fresh Apple

<!-- image -->

## Food  'series'  using  English  loanwords

However  a  name  for  some  new  food  develops,  a  series  of  spin-offs  of  similar foods  often develop.  For  example,  apple-flavoured candies  from several companies  are  now  popular.  The  Senjaku  company  also  has  a  hard apple candy, Straight  Apple  Juice  Candy, although  their  apples  come  from Nagano rather  than Aomori.  Sweet Candy's Milk  Sumomo  Candy j u s t  has  an  apple  flavour that  'spreads  in  your  mouth'.  Gooey  apple  candies  also  abound.  For  example, although  Bourbon's Applesoft sounds  like  some  kind  of  Macintosh  computer application,  it really is a candy with  an  apple  flavouring  surrounded  by a  creamy

milk  covering.  Kasugai's Apple  Gummy and  taste  of  a  slice  of  apple.

is  like  Gummy  Bears,  but  in  the  shape

A  soft  a n d  gummy  apple  product  called Super Apple has  also been i n t r o d u c e d  by  t h e  Santa  Booeki  company.  However,  this  company  has  a  whole series  of  'super'  flavours,  including Super  Lemon and Super  Cola. Such  series phenomena  are  not  limited  to  candies  or  snacks,  however. Honey  and Lemon soft  drinks  are  distributed  by  most  of  the  major  beverage  brands,  including Suntory's Honey  &amp;  Lemon, Calpis's Hachimitsu Remon  C ( ' H o n e y  and  Lemon C ) , a n d  Kagome's Hachimitsu &amp;  Remon ('Honey  &amp; Lemon')  .

## Conclusion:  English  loanwords  in  the  packaging  of Japanese  foods

These  examples  clearly  show,  I  think,  that  English  loanwords  are  commonly used  for  both  hybrid  'Western-like'  processed  new  foods (but not actually Western),  and  traditional Japanese  snacks  and  foods.  That  is, these  new  foods are  not  mere  poor  imitations  of American junk  food  or  fast  cuisine.  Likewise, t h e  use  of  loanwords  is  not just  an  attempt  to  be  cute  (or  again,  to  emulate America).  Instead,  there  are  many  sound  logical  and  linguistic  reasons  for using  English  loanwords  in  each  of  the  examples  given  above,  which are connected  to  the  social,  cultural,  and  economic  conditions  of Japan.

However,  there  are  also  some  interesting  similarities  with  the  way l o a n w o r d s  are  used  in  foods  and t h e  way Japanese  people  use English loanwords  in  another  sensory  domain  -  colour.  While  I will  examine  colour in  more  detail  in  the  next  chapter,  I  would  like  to  briefly  make a  few speculations  on  these  resemblances,  as I do  not  think  they  are  coincidental.  I first  became  interested  in  the  loanword  phenomenon  while  examining  how English  colour  terms were  used  in various Japanese  contexts. Many of the  same strategies  that  I  have just  described  for  foods  are  also  seen  in  the  domain  of colour  nomenclature.  For  example,  many  of  my Japanese  informants  would ' i n vent'  new  English  colour  terms,  like white blue, when  asked  to  name  unusual colours. As we  have  seen,  to  describe  peculiar  tastes  or  textures  -  such  as HiSOFT strawberries  -Japanese  food  marketers  also  do  similar  things.  In  the face  of  uncertainty,  ambiguous  colours  were  often  easily  named  with  English l o a n words ( a l t h o u g h  often  Japanese  terms  could  only  be  used  with  some difficulty).  Yet,  these  newly  created  words  are  transparent  to  the  consumer, transmitting  clear  images  and  feelings.  Likewise, what  else  could  you  name  a candy with  a strawberry  centre  surrounded  by a yoghurt  cube  -  like a  caramel -  besides 'Strawberry  Yoghurt  Chocolate'?

To  give  another  example,  as I mentioned  before,  my Japanese  informants used  English  colour  terms  strategically  to  achieve  sociolinguistic  ends.  No women  wanted  to  a  buy  a  grey  dress  that  was nezumi-iro (literally  meaning ' mouse-coloured'),  but  they were  more  than  happy  to wear  one  that  was guree.

In  a  similar  way,  while  few diet foods  or  soft  drinks  are  found in J a p a n (as  I have  explained  before),  while light foods  are  common.

It  is possible  that  the  English  loanword  phenomenon  found  in  the  domain of  food  is just  the  tactile/taste  counterpart  to  the  visual  responses  in t h e domain  of  colour.  In Japanese,  there  may  be  a similar  'linguistic  synaesthesia' occurring  between  these  two  domains.  It  is  not  clear  if Japanese gourmets ' t a s t e '  foods  named  with  English  loanwords  -  like Blue  Dry  Ice c a n d i e s  differently  from  those  named  with  native Japanese  terms. But  the  connotations and  psychological  responses  may  often  be  different,  and  that  alone  might  be enough  to  influence  physiological  -  and  indeed,  culinary  -  response.  This linguistic  synaesthesia  will  be  discussed  in  Chapter  10, after  the  discussion  of colours  in  Chapter  9.

From  neon  oranges  to shocking

## Introduction

Colour  nomenclature  has  been  an  ongoing  concern  in  anthropology  for  well over  a  h u n d r e d  years, ever  since  ethnographers  discovered  that  exotic  peoples all  over  the  world  have  differing  colour  systems;  that  is, ways  of  naming  and labelling  colours  of  the  world. 1 It  was  odd  for  these  early  anthropologists  and linguists  to  find  a  supposedly  natural  stimulus  as  the  colour  spectrum  could be  divided  up,  that  is,  labelled,  in  seemingly  endless  different  ways.  This variation  in  colour  vocabulary  provided  evidence  for  linguistic  relativism.  It was  actually  the  only  good  solid  evidence  that  seemed  to  indicate  empirically that  there  was  nothing  inherent  in  either  human  perception  or  the  physical world  that  would  compel  a  language  to  name  some  domain  in  any  particular fashion.

In  1969, however,  Berlin  and  Kay  (Berlin  and  Kay,  1969;  1991)  and  others demonstrated  cross-culturally  that  there  are  some  severe  constraints  on  colour nomenclature  systems;  for  instance,  on  the  way  they  operate,  how  they  are used,  how  they  develop,  and  how  they  evolve. In  short,  if certain  salient  colour t e r ms  are  assumed  to  be  'basic',  there  is  a  universal  ordering  to  the  colour spectrum,  and  how  colours  are  named.  In  addition,  there  are  also  limitations on  which  colours  can  take  which  label.  These  eleven  so-called  'basic'  colour categories  -  WHITE and  BLACK; RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, BROWN; and  PURPLE, PINK,  ORANGE, and  GREY -  were  thought  to  be  universal  across  cultures.  As l a n g u a g e s  and  cultures  evolve  and  develop  new  terms  for  colours,  they  will do  so  approximately  in  this  order.  By the  mid-1990s,  several  hundred studies (cf.  the  World  Color  Survey,  1991; Kay, Berlin,  and  Merrifield,  1991)  supported t h e  general  tenets  of  the  Berlin  and  Kay  model.  Although  modified and refined,  the  universalist  arguments  of Berlin  and  Kay have  remained  principally intact,  although  there  have  been  philosophical  (e.g.  Saunders  and  van  Brakel 1988;  Saunders,  1992)  as well  as  empirical  (Lucy,  1992)  challenges.

In  this  chapter,  I  will  discuss  some  results  from  Japanese  that offer contributions  to colour  nomenclature  theory, the specific  claims of the  Berlin and  Kay findings,  and  notions  of linguistic  relativity. Because  of their  attempt to make an  overall  cross-cultural  comparison,  Berlin  and  Kay  understandably neglected  several crucial  issues related  to  the  specifics  of the Japanese  colour nomenclature  system. They failed,  for  example,  to examine  the  pervasive  use of  loanwords  in  the Japanese  language  in  general  and  in  the  colour  term vocabulary in particular.  For example, several English  loanword  colour  terms are more salient  than  their  native Japanese  counterparts.  It even appears  that the Japanese  colour  lexicon  consists  of  two sets of  mutually  exclusive  terms, one  of  native Japanese  origin,  the  other  borrowed  from  English.  I  will demonstrate  in  this  chapter  that  English  loanwords  are  replacing  native Japanese  colour  terms, and  that  they seem  to be  doing so in  reverse order  to the  Berlin  and  Kay evolutionary  sequence.

Colour  nomenclature  investigation  is  a  critical  issue  in  linguistics, philosophy, and  anthropology  (cf.  Kay, Berlin and  Merrifield,  1991; MacLaury, 1992;  1997; Hardin  and  Maffi,  1997; Cohen,  2000; Kay 2000;). 2 It  is also  one of  the  most  contentious. 3 Whatever  the  final  verdict  will  be  in  terms  of  the Sapir-Whorf  Hypothesis  or  psycholinguistic  universals,  colour  research  has repercussions  in  all areas  of cognitive  science. For  this  reason,  if for  nothing else,  the Japanese  case study merits close  scrutiny.

## Berlin  and  Kay, and  basic  colour  terms

Berlin and Kay tested colour naming by presenting informants  with an  acetate chart of the spectrum, similar to samples of paint chips found  in most hardware stores.  The  basic  idea  was to  use  an  array  of  320  colour  chips  taken  from  a flattened  'Mercator'  projection  of the three-dimensional  colour sphere as given in The Munsell Book of Color, varying on  the  dimensions  of hue  and  brightness. Informants  were asked  to mark  on  this erasable  acetate which  colours  would match a particular term  (e.g. 'please circle all the chips you call X'); they called this a color  term's  'range'. In addition,  informants  were asked  to pick a single chip on  the array that was the best example  of that term; thus termed  a  'focal colour'.

As  is  well  known,  there  was  great  variety  between  languages  in  how informants  would  choose  colours. Different  languages  had  different  numbers of  colours,  as well  as apparent  differences  in  reference.  For  example,  in  an earlier similar study of Zuni and English, Lenneberg and Roberts  (1956)  found that while English  YELLOW and  ORANGE categories were separate, in  Zuni  they were one category. They also discovered  that in English categories vary greatly in  size  (i.e.  RED  being  very  small  and  GREEN  being  very  large),  but  Zuni categories were  generally  about  the  same size.

When such an array was presented  to informants,  it was found  that  almost any kind  of configuration  of colour  names was possible. Until  the  late  1960s, colour  was taken  as the  best,  if not  the  only,  empirically-grounded  evidence for  linguistic  relativism.  That  is, it was  thought  that  languages  and  cultures could  vary in  their  colour  nomenclature  almost without  constraint,  and  that there  would  be  no a priori way of  knowing  how  any  particular  colour  term system  might  appear.  Indeed,  the  variety  found  in  colour  nomenclature seemed  to indicate  that there is nothing inherent  in either human  perceptual facilities  or  the  physical  world  that  would  compel  a language  to  name  some domain  in  any particular  fashion.

However, Berlin and  Kay re-examined  colours using these  techniques  but with  a slightly different  - although  ultimately very important -  perspective. The  critical  theoretical  insight  made  by Berlin  and  Kay was that  colour  terms need  to  be  restricted  and  operationalized.  There  are  many  local  colours  in every language, for  example, which  mostly depend  on  the  particulars  of  the environment.  'This shirt  is "the  colour  of  the jaguar"  '  makes  sense, and  is a perfectly  good  term,  if everyone  in  the  village  has seen  a jaguar.  Westerners, of course, use thousands of these  'secondary colour terms' as well: denim  blue, fire-engine  red,  olive green,  birch  white, and  so on.  In fact,  much  of  modern marketing  probably  depends  on  the  creation  of secondary  colour  terms  for products  (such  as the  colours  of automobiles  or  paints)  which  are  appealing particularly  because  their  secondary  referents  are  very vivid  and  conjure  up certain  emotions, such as 'chili pepper  red'  for  a hot new sports car. But what do you  do  if there  are  no  fire  engines,  or jaguars, where  you  live? Are  there some more general abstract notions of colours that all cultures seem  to have?

Berlin and Kay decided  to operationally define  abstract  'basic' terms using a  number  of criteria,  including  the  following  (1969:  5-7):

1. The  term  in  question  is monolexemic  and  unanalysable. This means  that compound  terms  or  terms  that  are  grammatically  or  morphologically modified  should  not  be  thought  of  as basic. Thus,  'red'  and  'blue'  are basic colours in English, but  'reddish',  'blue-green',  or  'light red'  are  not. Also, a  term's  meaning  should  not  be  predictable  from  the  meaning  of its parts  (thus  excluding words like  'sunburst'  or  'olive  green'  as basic  in English).
2. The  meaning  of the  term  in  question  is not included  in  the  range  of any other  term; the focus of a basic colour term should not be included within the  boundary  of any other  colour  term.  Thus, because  'khaki'  is 'a  kind of brown',  it would  not be an  English  basic colour  term. This also  means that  subsets  of colours  are  not  basic  colours.  'Navy blue'  presumably  is a kind  of blue, and  therefore  not  a basic colour  term  in  English.
3. The  term  in  question  must  have wide applicability,  and  not  be  restricted to  any single  referent  - or just  a few  referents  - but  should  exist as an abstract  label widely applicable  to all objects.  Using  this  criteria,  then,  a

- term  like  'blonde'  is not  basic in  English  because  it usually only refers  to hair  colour.
4. The  term  in  question  must  be  psychologically  salient with  respect  to  the number  of speakers who use the  term, and  the  number  of occasions  it is used; that is, the term must be psychologically conspicuous, either in  terms of frequency  of usage or extensive occurrence and acceptability in a speech community.  Thus,  'sepia'  in  English  would  not  qualify  as a basic  colour term  as  it  is  not  well  known  to  all  speakers.  This  best  way to  grasp  the notion  of psychological  salience  is do a little  experiment  yourself. Take a moment  and  write  down  the first  ten  colour  terms  that  come  to  mind.  I suspect your list has words like 'white', 'red',  'blue', and  'black' in it. There is probably  no  'mauve'  or  'chartreuse'  (just  as  in  a  box  of  crayons  you would not find  these colours unless you bought the giant unabridged  set). This  psychological  salience  is  one  of  the  most  important criteria demonstrating  basic colour  term  status.

They also argued  that  recent  foreign  loanwords  are  suspect,  but  I will  argue that  this  is actually an  important  theoretical  oversight.

## Results

The results of the  Berlin  and  Kay experiments were quite surprising. In  brief, their  conclusions were as follows:

1. In all languages, there were at least two, but no more than eleven or twelve, colour  terms  that  could  be  considered  as  'basic'.
2. These  basic  colour  terms  were  thought  to  label  universal  perceptual categories  ('psychological  referents')  of which there are probably no  more than  eleven.
3. These basic colour categories are historically encoded  in a given  language in  one  of  two possible  orderings,  as given  in  Figure 9.1.

This  last finding  is most  intriguing  and  very important.  Languages  seem  to develop colour categories in severely limited ways, in seven steps or stages  (as labelled  in  roman  numerals  in Figure 9.1). All languages of the world  have  at least  two terms: one  for  the whites and  light colours  (which  I will call M A C R O WHITE) and  one for  the  blacks and  the dark colours  (which  I will call  MACROBLACK). These are found  at Stage I in Figure 9.1. 4 If a language has only  three basic  colour  terms  (that  is,  it  lies  at  Stage  II  in  the  chart),  these  colour categories would  almost  always cover  the  same  range  of chips:  MACRO-WHITE (the  whites  and  light  colours),  MACRO-BLACK  (the  blacks,  purples,  and  dark colours), and  MACRO-RED  (the  reds, oranges, yellows, and  pinks). That  is, the

Figure 9.1 The modified  initial Berlin and  Kay colour encoding  sequence

<!-- image -->

previous  MACRO-WHITE category  has split,  giving up  some  of  its light  colours (the  reds, oranges, and yellows)  to form  a new term, MACRO-RED.

Before  I describe  the  next  stages in  Figure  9.1, I should  define  the G R U E term. Linguists, anthropologists,  and  psychologists  have long recognized  that many language-cultures  have a single word  that  labels  the  colours  that,  most English  speakers  would  say, covers  all  the  green  and  blue  hue  (that  is,  they might,  for  instance,  claim  that  fresh  grass  and  a  summer  sky are  the  same colour). These languages are so common,  in fact,  that a special term - GRUE, a combination  of green and blue, obviously - has been invented to talk  about them.  These  speakers  are  by no  means  colour-blind;  they just  do  not  make

these  distinctions  in their  everyday  speech  (much  like  English  speakers  ignore all  t h e differences  in the  red  and  scarlet  ranges  unless  they  are  compelled  to do  so).  Although  this  is a  simplification,  it  could  be said  that  it was t h e ethnographic  discovery a century  ago  that  set  the  foundation  for the  interest in  colour  nomenclature  that  has  fascinated  anthropologists  until  the twentyfirst  century.

The  next  two stages  (III  and  IV)  in Figure  9.1  complement  each  other, as l a n g u a g e s  can develop  in  o n e of  two  ways  in  their  growth  of  colour terminology.  For  the  first  case  (shown  on the  right  side of the  chart),  the  next t e r m  to develop  is a GRUE term  (at Stage  III)  followed  by a YELLOW term  at Stage IV.  T h e o t h e r  possibility  - shown  on the left  side  - is that  the  YELLOW category will  develop  (Stage  III)  followed  by a GRUE term  at Stage  IV. At  Stage V, the GRUE term  divides  and the GREEN and  BLUE separations  occur;  that  is, all  languages  at this  stage  have  six  colour  terms  or categories:  WHITE, BLACK, RED,  YELLOW, BLUE, and  GREEN. The  next  term  to appear  is BROWN at Stage  VI. At  Stage  VII,  the colours  PINK,  ORANGE,  or PURPLE,  could  appear  in any  order or  combination.  (The  GREY term,  although  usually  occurring  at Stage  VII, is sort  of a wild  card,  occasionally  appearing  at unusual  places  in the order at Stage  III or later).

The  significance  of these  findings  was  the discovery  that  ultimately the way languages  divide up the  colour  spectrum  is not  arbitrary at all. If we  assume for  the  m o m e n t  that  there  are  only  eleven  basic  colour  terms,  there  could be 2,048  different  possible  colour  figurations  (i.e.  2 11 )  taking  these  eleven  terms and  permuting  them  on their  presence  or absence  in any given  language.  For example,  we  could  theoretically  find  languages  that  have  the  following  set of colour  terms:  RED,  BLUE,  PINK,  and  GREY; or  BLACK,  BROWN,  and  PURPLE;  or  BLUE, YELLOW, BROWN, PINK,  PURPLE, and WHITE. But these  are never  found.  If a l a n guage  has, for instance,  six  basic  colour  terms  (WHITE, BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, and BLUE), we know  that  the  term  which  will  always  appear  next is BROWN and no  other.

Berlin  and  Kay also  found  a high  degree  of consistency  in the  naming of focal  colours.  For  example,  the  chip  that  most  informants  named  as the  best example  of RED  in English  usually  matched  closely with  chips  selected  in other l a nguages.  Also,  later  experimental  results  from  the fields  by Rosch (1973) and  others  indicated  that  even  for languages  that  did not have  a  particular colour  label  for a colour,  the focal  colour  chips  were  always  the ones  most easily  recalled  or remembered.  Berlin  and Kay,  then,  concluded  that  these ' basic'  colour  terms  were  psychologically  special,  naming  universal  perceptual categories.

## Language  universals

The  impact  of  Berlin  and  Kay's work was noticed  immediately  for  its  challenge to  the  Sapir-Whorf  Hypothesis.  In  the  past  three  decades,  hundreds  of  other studies  seem  to  support  the  basic  tenets  of  the  Berlin  and  Kay  model. Nevertheless,  Berlin  and  Kay alone  did  not  tap  the  final  nails  in  the  coffin of linguistic  relativity.

In  the  mid-twentieth  century,  the  intellectual  climate  underwent  a  real sea  change  in  attitude  towards  languages  and  their  structures.  Until  the  1950s scholars  were  relativists.  They  were  most  fascinated by  the  wonders and plethora  of  linguistic  diversity  found t h r o u g h o u t  t h e  world.  Non-Western l a nguages  did  marvellous  things  that  the  Indo-European  languages  did  not; time  was  counted  in  different  ways,  and  words  were  found  for  concepts  that Europeans  had  not  an  inkling  of.  Categories  were  created  almost  out  of  thin air.  What  did  women,  fire,  and  dangerous  things,  for  example,  all  have  in common  that  made  the  Dyirbal  aboriginal  Australians  put  them  in  the  same class,  presumably  thinking  of  them  as  being  all  the  same  on  some  level? 5 In many ways this was a holdover  from  the  days of Franz  Boas  (1940), who  made passionate  arguments  for  relativism,  mostly  in  a valiant  attempt  to  undermine t he  scholarly  racist  claims  popular  until  even  the  Second  World  War.  To  Boas, a  belief  in  universalism  usually  led  to  comparisons  that  left  the  non-Western world  wanting.  Such  beliefs  were  only  one  small  step  away  from dangerous biological  reductionism:  people,  and  their  language,  are  the  way  they  are  due to  their  biology  (that  is, their  race). The  rise of Nazi  Germany  and  Nazi  science did  little  to  allay  his  fears.

However  in  the  1960s,  a  brilliant  young  linguist  named  Noam  Chomsky wrote  a  series  of  books  and  monographs  showing  that  'grammar'  across  all the  world's  languages  is very  much  the  same,  if you  peel  away at  the  language onion.  On  the  surface,  it  at  first  appears  that  the  almost  infinite  variety  of structures  and  forms  could  not  possibly  be  reconciled,  much  less  shown  to have  the  same  underlying  'deep'  structure,  but  this  is  exactly  what  Chomsky and  his  students  have  attempted.  They  have  made  a  compelling,  if  at  times overstated,  case;  but  there  is  no  doubt  that  there  is  much  more linguistic similarity  in  the  world  than  previously  thought  even  a  few  decades  ago.  More importantly  though,  this  'transformational  grammar' movement  has swayed  the court  of  scholarly  opinion  to  a  rejection  of  relativism  in  favour  of  universalism. 6 The  Berlin  and  Kay  findings,  coming  when  they  did,  were  at  the  proverbial right  place  at  the  right  time. But  does  this  mean  that  linguistic  relativity  is  dead (at  least  in  the  domain  of  colour)?  We  will  see  later  that  the  theories  of  Sapir and  Whorf,  at  least  in  their  weaker  versions,  are  still  viable t h e o r e t i c a l paradigms  and  still  provide  promising  areas  of  research.

## Cultures  in  contact:  The Japanese  case

In  brief,  I will argue  that  the Japanese  colour  lexicon  actually consists of  two sets of mutually exclusive terms, one of native origin, the other borrowed  from English. I suggest that English  loanwords are often  replacing native Japanese colour  terms, and  that  they seem  to be doing so in reverse order in the  Berlin and  Kay evolutionary  sequence  as shown  in Figure 9.1.

While  conducting  research  on  the  use  of English  loanwords  in Japan  in general  (in  1987,  1988, and  1998),  I  also  collected  data  on  colour  terms because much of the colour vocabulary in contemporary Japanese is borrowed from  English  (cf.  Stanlaw,  1987a;  1992a;  1992b;  1997a).  The  methods  I

followed were similar to those described by Berlin and Kay, and generally  used by most researchers  on  colour  nomenclature.  I first  collected  a list of  colour terms by simply asking informants  to name what they thought  to be the  salient colour  terms  in Japanese.  If  nothing  else,  I  thought  it  might  be  useful  to attempt to corroborate Berlin and Kay's original findings  (which were collected in  English  from  a single  bilingual  informant  living in  California).  The  results for  this  first  task  are  shown  in  Table  9.1  (an  expansion  of  Stanlaw,  1997a: 243). 7

Table  9.1  presents  the  frequency  counts  for  twenty-nine  Japanese colour  terms  given  as responses,  including  both  native Japanese  vocabulary items  and  English  loanwords.  Ninety-one  people  of various  ages were  asked to  write  down  those  colour  terms  they  thought  were  most  common  or  most important  in  everyday  life  in Japan.  Participants  were  encouraged  not  to deliberate  too  long  over  this  task  (three  to  five  minutes  at  most),  and  told that  no  more  than  the  first  fifteen  terms would  be  examined.  They were  also informed  that  less  than  the  maximum  number  of  items  was  perfectly acceptable,  and  that  they  should  use  their  own judgement  regarding  the number  of terms  they considered  sufficient.

Participants  in  this survey ranged  from  8 to  62 years old.  For  tabulation, informants  have been  divided  into  the  following  five  groups:  (1)  elementary school  students  (aged  8, 9,  or  10);  (2) junior  high  and  senior  high  school students;  (3)  university  students  or  people  in  their  early  twenties;  (4)  adults aged  26 to 45; and  (5)  adults  over 45. Younger  students  generally  completed the  task  in  groups  in  a classroom,  or  a class-like  setting.  Older  students  and adults  often  completed  the  task  individually  or  in  small  groups,  in  locations suiting the convenience of the participants or research  (e.g. an office,  a private home,  a  university  building).  Discussion  and  instruction  was  generally conducted  in Japanese, except in a few cases where the participants  preferred using  English.  Table  9.2  (a  expansion  of  Stanlaw,  1997a:  244)  presents  the number of times that participants, broken down by age, cited a particular  form as an  important  colour  term  in Japanese.

The  percentages  next  to  each  number  indicate  the  fraction  of  the informants  in  that  age  group  who  cited  that  term.  For  example,  96  percent of  the  elementary  school  students  (or  22 out  of 23 school  children)  believed shiro ( WHITE) to be an  important  and  basic colour  term. In  the  'Total'  column the percentages  represent  responses for  all age categories  taken  in  aggregate. For  example,  97 percent  (or  88 out  of  all 91  respondents)  considered shiro (WHITE)  to be  an  important  colour  term. Note  that all percentages  have  been rounded  off  and  terms  that  appeared  fewer  than  four  times are  not  cited. To facilitate  reading,  the  data  in both  Tables 9.1 and  9.2 have been  grouped  into three  sections: the original basic colour  terms in Japanese  given by Berlin  and Kay, other native Japanese colour terms mentioned by informants, and  English loanword  colour  terms  given  by  informants.

Note: Terms  mentioned  less than  five  times  by informants  are  not  listed;  percentages  are  calculated  on that  fraction  of  those  terms  appearing  above,  ignoring  terms  not  meeting  the  five-term criterion.

Table 9.3  (a expansion  of Stanlaw,  1997a: 245)  lists the  colour  terms given  in Tables 9.1 and 9.2 in decreasing order of saliency for all informants. This  table takes the percentages  given in Table 9.2 and  puts them in rank order,  highest to lowest, regardless  of a term's status as  'basic', loanword,  or  native Japanese colour  term.

Most colour-research  fieldworkers  have noted  that it is not  always easy to determine  the  real  basic  colour  terms  in  a  language. 8 In Japanese,  the

difficulties  in  defining  basic  colour  terms  are  compounded  by several  factors. First,  the Japanese  morphological  system  regarding  colour  terms  is  rather intricate.  Every Japanese  colour  term  can,  or  must,  interact  with  a  number  of productive  morphemes.  For  example,  there  are  many  complexities  regarding colour  adjectival  forms,  and  the  use  of  productive  morphemes  to  indicate  the degree  of  saturation  of  hue  (e.g.  . . . -gakatta, ' t i n g e d  with  .  .  .';  or  .  .  . -ppoi, '  .  .  .  - i s h ' )  are  often  problematic.  Almost  any Japanese  noun  can  be  made into  a  colour  term  by simply adding  the  suffix -iro ('coloured')  (Stanlaw,  1987a: 85-118).

Such  problems  are  exacerbated  even  more  when  we  consider  the  second point:  how  colour  terms  are  used  in  the Japanese  writing  system.  Simply  put,

the  problem  comes down  to what actually constitutes a word in Japanese. Is it a  spoken  set  of  phonemes?  Or  is it a written  character  or  set  of  characters that  are  the  units  of  analysis?  As we  have  seen  in  Chapter  4  (see  also  the Appendix)  that, because  Sino-Japanese  characters were borrowed  more  than a  millennium  ago  over  the  course  of  several  centuries,  most  Japanese characters  today have a multitude  of pronunciations. For example, if the B L U E colour  term  is thought  to be ao-iro (  Wfe  ), what  is the  status  of  the  alternate pronunciation  of this set of characters, sei-shoku?

We see, then, that the traditional Berlin and  Kay criteria of unanalysability, productivity,  and  morphological  complexity - as given above - may not  be sufficient to  determine  a  lexeme's  basic  colour  term  status  in  Japanese. However,  recall  that  two  other  criteria  remain.  Berlin  and  Kay claim  that  a candidate basic colour term's signification  should not be included in the  range of  any  other  term.  They  also  argue  that  a  basic  colour  term  must  be psychologically  salient  for  informants.  Evidence  for  this  would  include occurrence  at the beginning of elicitation lists, and occurrence  in the  idiolects of all informants. Therefore,  I used these two criteria as the main  determinants of basic colour  term  status in Japanese: frequency  salience, and  the  evidence of inclusion  from  the  mapping  tasks.

The  literature  suggests  that  frequency  salience  is actually  a very  good indicator of basic-ness. For example, Hayes, et al. (1972)  in a statistical analysis of five literary languages  (English, Spanish, French, German, and Russian, with additional evidence from  Hebrew and Romanian)  found  that salience - when defined  as frequency  of use - correlates with the order of the Berlin and Kay evolutionary  sequence. That  is, in  general,  the  most frequently-used  terms  in these  languages  are  WHITE and  B L A C K , the  next  most frequently-used  term  is RED, and  so on,  throughout  the evolutionary order. Using later sets of English frequency  tables  (e.g. from  Francis and Kucera,  1982 and  Carroll et al.; 1971), I  found  support  for  Hayes'  conclusions  (which  used  data  gathered  in  the 1940s).  Also,  evidence,  too,  from  Bolton  (1978)  and  Bolton,  Curtis,  and Thomas  (1980)  generally is  confirming.

In  examining  frequency  data  of Japanese  newspapers  and  magazines gathered  by the Japanese  National  Language  Research  Institute  (Kokuritsu Kokugo  Kenkyuujo,  1964; 1970;  1971; 1972;  1973), I found  that  frequency/ salience  seems  to  correlate  with  the  Berlin  and  Kay evolutionary  sequence (Stanlaw,  1987a:  111-6). Thus, there  appears  to be strong evidence  to believe that the salience data given in Tables 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3 reflect  basic colour  term status in Japanese  to at least a fair  degree.

Informants  were  also  asked  to  perform  a  mapping  task  using  the  most frequently-found  terms  in Table  9.3. This was an  extension  of the  Berlin  and Kay data given for Japanese  (p. 123)  using both  (1)  a much  larger number  of informants,  and  (2)  a greater sample of candidate basic colour terms  (namely, English  loanword  colour  terms and  some  other  native Japanese  colour  terms

that  appear  to  satisfy  many  of  the  'basic'  criteria).  Figures  9.2  and  9.3  give the modal focal colours for the eleven Berlin-Kay colour categories in Japanese, both  for  native  terms and  English  loanwords  (Stanlaw,  1997a: 248-9).  Figures 9.4  and  9.5  do  the  same  for  category  ranges  (Stanlaw,  1997a:  250-1).

An  examination  of  these  figures  shows several  things.  In  particular,  we should  notice  that  English  loanword  colour  terms  are  not  mapped synonymously with  native Japanese  colour  terms. This was common  for  most informants  interviewed.  For  example,  Figures  9.6  (Stanlaw,  1997a:  252)  and 9.7 show the native Japanese and English loanword colour maps for one  typical informant,  Y. K., a 25-year-old  female.  Figures  9.8  (Stanlaw,  1997a:  253)  and 9.9  show the  data  gathered  from  a 21-year-old  male  (K. E.). 9 In  both  cases, it is easily seen  that  the  focal  colours  (marked  with  a plus sign)  and  the  ranges vary extensively.  In  general,  the  number  of chips  chosen  as focals  for  native Japanese colour categories is different  from  those chosen for English  loanword colours,  and  most  focals  seem  to  be  brighter  by  at  least  one  step  on  the brightness  level  than  their  native Japanese  counterparts.  When  considering the  ranges  of  the  colour  terms, a similar  phenomenon  is found.  That  is, in general, English loanword colour terms seem to be thought of as brighter  than their  native Japanese  correspondents.

Using the  mapping  data above, and  the  salience  data  given  in Tables 9.1, 9.2, and  9.3, a set of basic colour  terms might look like that found  in Table  9.4 (an  extension  of Stanlaw,  1997a: 254).

The  first  thing  to  notice  about  this  list,  or  the  data  given  in  Table  9.3,  is that  the  Berlin  and  Kay proposed  order  is closely followed,  at  least  for  the  first eight Japanese  colour  terms. The  sole  exception  is that aka (RED)  is just  slightly more  salient  than kuro (BLACK). Apart  from  this very minor  deviation,  the  rank order  does  nothing  to  contradict  the  theoretical  evolutionary  sequence. However,  from  rank  eight  on,  the  connections  with  the  Berlin  and  Kay  order are  almost  completely  severed.

In  places  9,  10, and  11 of  Table  9.4,  the  Berlin  and  Kay sequence  predicts t h a t  we  should  find momo-iro (PINK;  literally ' p e a c h - c o l o u r e d ' ) , daidai-iro (ORANGE; literally  'orange-coloured'),  and nezumi-iro (GREY; literally  'mousecoloured') or hai-iro (GREY;  literally ' a s h - c o l o u r e d ' ) as  t h e  next colour categories,  in  any  order.  Instead,  in  the  next  three  ranks  we  find  two  English loanword  colour  terms  pinku ('pink')  and orenji ( ' o r a n g e ' )  -  and  a  native Japanese  colour  term, kon (something  like  'dark  blue').  Interestingly,  both loanwords pinku and orenji appear  in  the  sequence  where  we would  expect  the PINK and  ORANGE category  terms  to  be.  However,  the  native Japanese momo-iro (PINK)  was  only  given  by  4  percent  of  informants,  while  the  English  loanword pinku was given  by 43 percent.  Likewise, daidai-iro (ORANGE) was named  by  only 4  p e r c e n t  of  informants  while  the  English  loanword orenji was  cited  by  39 percent.  Apparently,  these  two  English  loanword  colour  terms  are,  in effect, substituting  for  the  native Japanese  terms  as  labels  for  the  PINK and  ORANGE categories.

The  next  five  ranks  in  Table  9.4  are  also  in  contradiction  to  the  standard model. Hai-iro (Berlin  and  Kay's Japanese  GREY term)  appears  but  so does guree (the  English  loanword  'grey')  shortly  afterward;  both  were  named  by  about 12  to  15  percent  of  informants.  The  other Japanese  GREY term, nezumi-iro, was only  named  by  5  percent  of  respondents.  Several  English  loanword colour terms,  then,  are  highly salient  in  the  minds  of most Japanese  informants. Pinku, orenji, and guree are  used  much  more  frequently  than  the corresponding Japanese  terms momo-iro (PINK), daidai-iro (ORANGE), and nezumi-iro (GREY)  which are  cited  as  basic  by  Berlin  and  Kay.  These  native Japanese  colour  terms  do not  appear  until  the  very  bottom  of  the  list  in  Table  9.4.  In  other  words,  at least  these  three  English  loanword  colour  terms  pinku, orenji a n d guree -seem  to  be  as  basic  as  their  native Japanese  equivalents,  and  in  fact,  may  be replacing  them  for  all  practical  purposes.  Indeed,  English  loanword  colour terms  may  be  in  the  process  of  replacing  a  number  of  native Japanese  colour terms, and  I suggest  that Japanese  may be  substituting  English  loanword  colour terms  for  native Japanese  forms  in  reverse  order  of  the  evolutionary  sequence. For  example,  we  might  predict  that  native Japanese murasaki (PURPLE)  or chairo (BROWN)  could  be  the  next  colour  terms  that  are  replaced  (by the  loanwords paapuru and buraun respectively).

One  other  piece  of  evidence  suggests  that  these  replacements  of  native J a p a n e s e  colour  terms  have  become  firmly  established  in  the  minds of

J a p a n e s e .  The  eminent  Princeton  linguist  Seiichi  Makino  has r e c e n t l y compiled,  along  with  two  colleagues,  Seiichi  Nakada  and  Mieko  Ohso,  an i ntriguing  new  kind  of  English-Japanese  dictionary  (Makino  et  al.,  1999).  As far  as  I  know,  this  is  the  first  dictionary  of  its  kind,  based  strictly  on  bilingual semantics  rather  than  mere  glosses. For  example,  for  English  PINK Makino  and his  colleagues  show  (p.  703)  that what  this  term  refers  to  is 'a  pale  red  colour'. To  their way of  thinking,  the  two Japanese  terms  for  PINK momo-iro and pinku -  both  refer  to  slightly  different  ideas  ('the  colour  of  peach  flowers'  and ' a pale  bluish  red  colour'  respectively).  That  is, neither  'peach'  nor  'pale  bluish r e d '  correspond  exactly  to  'pale  red'.  Likewise,  there  are  differences  in  use. While  it  is possible  to  have  both  terms  to  modify  a  sweater  -  as  in {momo-iro / pinku] no seetaa tlfcfe/tf  &gt;£&lt;£&gt;-£ -i7  - 'a  pink  sweater'  momo-iro c a n n o t  be used  to  modify,  say,  lipstick: {*momo-iro /  pinku] no  kuchibeni *ty\&amp;/\£&gt;$&lt;DU ' p i n k  lipstick'.

Apart from  the  restrictions  on  the  PINK term,  the  citations  in  this  dictionary seem  to suggest  that  the  replacement  hypothesis  may be justified.  For  example, no  citation  is given  for daidai-iro, t he  traditional  native Japanese  ORANGE  term (and  the  one  used  by Berlin  and  Kay),  but orenji is  given.  For  GREY terms,  it  is noted  (p.  409)  that  for  fashion  and  clothes  the  native Japanese  terms hai-iro and nezumi-iro carry  negative  connotations,  with  the  loanword guree being preferred.  ALS dictionaries  are  intentionally  composed  by  lexicographers,  it cannot  necessarily  be  assumed  that  their  citations  reflect  statistical  saliency  in the  real  world.  However,  there  is nothing  here  that  counters  the  replacement hypothesis.

## The  significance  of  the Japanese  colour  categories,  and  their effects  on  language

There  are  two  fundamental questions  regarding t h e  Berlin a n d Kay evolutionary  sequence  (i.e. the  order  shown  in  Figure  9.1):  (1)  Why  does  the evolutionary  sequence  exist in  the  first  place, and  (2)  what  are  the  mechanisms t h a t  cause  a  language/culture  to  move  along  the  sequence?  As yet,  no  one has  given  a  definitive  answer  to  the  first  question,  although  some  (e.g.  Kay and  McDaniel,  1978)  have  argued  for  a  physiological  or neurological explanation.  I will  not  go  further  into  the  first  question  here,  although  I  have previously  argued  (1987a)  that  languages  encode  colour  terms  by  alternating on  extremes  of  brightness  and  hue.  The  second  question,  however,  is no  less vexing,  and  is  equally  important.  The Japanese  data  again  suggests  that  the standard  Berlin  and  Kay model  needs  to  be  extended  in  several  crucial  ways.

Berlin  and  Kay  have  tried  to  explain  the  dynamics  of  the  evolutionary colour  term  sequence  as  due  to  cultural  and  technological  complexity.  They argue  that  in  small  societies,  where  the  local  environment  is well  known  to

everyone,  secondary  colour  terms  are  not  only  sufficient but  actually advantageous.  If all  people  know  'plant  X', then the  secondary  colour  term 'colour  of plant X'  carries more  information  than  some  hypothetical  abstract colour  name.  When  technology  and  group  size  increase,  general  abstract colour terms are  required  to convey information  to people who may not  have the same referent  in their environment.  Increasing technology, especially with regards to colour-processing such as dyeing, would also require more  emphasis on  abstract  colour  terms.

These  arguments  no  doubt  contain  some  truth. The  Berlin  and  Kay data (1969:  16)  indicates  that  cultures  with  small  populations  and limited technologies  have  few  basic  colour  terms,  while  complex  and highly industrialized  societies  have  the  most.  But  what  happens  when  a  culture reaches  a  certain  level  of  technological  sophistication  and linguistic development with respect to basic colour terms? Do they stop evolving?  There is no reason  to assume so, although  it might be hard for  (say, English)  speakers at  the  pinnacle  of  the  sequence  to  imagine  how  subsequent  stages  would appear. Yet it is probably equally bizarre for the Dani, with only two basic colour terms in their language, to imagine how and for what purpose  the  Europeans construct  their  colour  world.

The Japanese  data  suggests  at  least  three  techniques  which  could encourage further  development of the evolutionary sequence:  (1) a language/ culture  could  create  new basic  colour  categories  (such  as a  'dark  blue'  or  a 'yellow-green');  (2)  a language/culture  could  increase  the  number  of  terms available  for  basic  colour  term  status  through  extensive  borrowing  of loanwords;  and  (3)  a  language/culture  could  replace  native  terms  in  the evolutionary  sequence  with  loanwords. AJ1 three  processes  are  found  in  the illustrations  in  this  chapter.

The  first  case would  posit  the  existence  of  unanalysable,  mono-lexemic, 'basic'  terms labelling a distinctly defined  colour space. Native Japanese  terms such  as kon (dark  blue), and  possibly a few others, indicate  that  Japanese  may have  twelve or  more  basic colour  categories  (as opposed  to  the  maximum  of eleven  cited  by Berlin  and  Kay)  (cf.  Stanlaw,  1987a;  1997a). The  number  of English  loanword  colour  terms found  in Japanese  is extensive. Besides  some of the  'basic' English  labels, several borrowed  English secondary colour  terms, like kaaki ('khaki'), beeju ('beige'), remon ( ' l e m o n'), kuriimu-iro ('cream[coloured]'),  or emerarudu guriin ('emerald  green'),  are  more  salient  than many Japanese basic or secondary colour terms. Thus, a pool of abstract  terms (i.e. those  not as strongly connected  to a referent  as are many native Japanese labels)  could  be  available  for  use  in  creating  new  colour  descriptions  or creating  new colour  categories.

The  third  mechanism,  replacing native Japanese  colour  terms by English loanwords, could  let the  native  terms become  re-lexified,  possibly taking  new denotative and connotative meaning. They might even eventually come to label a  new basic  colour  category.

Obviously,  the  presence  of  every English  loanword  colour  term  -  basic or secondary - does not imply the existence of a new category in the Japanese colour nomenclature system. However, considering the length of time  required for  languages  to  evolve, availability  might  increase  probability. An  awareness of  English  loanword  colour  terms  -  presumably  known  by speakers  to  be different  somehow from  native Japanese  colour terms - might prompt  people to  experiment  with  these  auxiliary  terms in  a wide variety of ways.

## Conclusion:  Loanwords,  universals  and  particulars

The English loanword  colour term evidence shows interesting universalist  and particularist  interactions when  colours and  cultures come in contact.  General universalist  properties, like  the  Berlin  and  Kay encoding sequence, are  found for  the Japanese  data, but we have seen  also how specific  social and  linguistic situations,  such  as  borrowing,  modified them.  That  is,  the universalist arguments  of  Berlin  and  Kay  do  not  necessarily  refute all  Whorfian considerations under all conditions. Languages can certainly vary semantically, but obviously not without constraint; people cannot  just call anything anything, after  all.  However,  these  constraints  are  often  a  complex  interface  of  both human  cognitive  universals, and  the  particulars  of cultures  and  languages  in contact.  It  is on  this  edge  that  much  of  the  linguistic  and  social  action  takes place.

## Introduction

In  this  chapter  I will  first  discuss  some  relationships  between  perception, culture,  and  language  in Japan.  This in  itself is hardly  original.  Semioticians, whether Asian specialists or not,  have long been  interested  in  this country. As we have seen  in  Chapter  7, this so-called  'empire  of signs', as one  of the  most famous  French  scholars  (Barthes,  1982)  called  the  islands,  is  supposedly fraught  with marauding  signifiers  of every kind, and  the humblest  of  gestures is vested with arcane  meaning and  Eastern  mystery. Much  has been  said  about Japan's  infatuation  with  the  West,  but  the  West  has  been  equally  fascinated with Japan,  whether  it  be  the  marvels  of  a  culture  in  miniature  or  the quaintness  of old  temples juxtaposed  between  modern  skyscrapers and  bullet trains.

Linguists  and  anthropologists  have also found Japan  to be  an  interesting place. Often, Japanese  is chosen  to demonstrate  different  facets  of the  SapirWhorf  Hypothesis,  where  some  peculiarity  of  a  language  is  thought  to influence  behaviour, cognition, and indeed perception itself. 1 I have also made such  arguments  myself  (Stanlaw,  1987a;  1997a).  However,  while Japan  is unique  in  many ways, it is important  not  to  carry  this  notion  too  far  (Dale, 1986).  Sometimes,  as  I  hope  to  show  here, Japan  can  actually  be  seen  as representative  of some  processes  that,  I suspect,  occur  in  many  other  places, albeit  in  modified  and  specific  forms.

In  this chapter, which  is an extrapolation  of the previous chapters in  some ways, I argue  that there  is a relationship  between  the senses and  many English loanwords  found  in Japanese.  I will  make  two  claims  regarding  the  ways perception  influences  language. First, it appears that every language or  culture has some  'basic'  sensations which  seem  especially prominent.  That  is,  things like  certain  colours,  flavours,  smells,  or  tones  seem  more  salient,  and  more easily  identified, than  others.  These  may  be  (1)  highly  biological or physiological  (as with  the  universal  colour  categories described  by Berlin  and

Kay [1969], and in Chapter 9); (2)  highly cultural  (as with the acquired  palate of  some  culture's  cuisine,  or  the  appreciation  of  the  sounds  of  some  music system); or  (3)  an  indeterminate  mixture  of both  (as in  tactile  sensations).

Second,  I claim  that  languages  have  a number  of  cognitive  or  linguistic devices, such  as invention,  analogy,  and  making  metonymic  connections,  to handle  the  more  vague,  non-predominant,  sensations.  In Japanese,  one common  technique  is the  extensive  use  of English  loanwords. For  example, when  asked  to name  unusual  or ambiguous  colours, Japanese  speakers  often create  English  names like  'grey purple'. In another  instance, a food  packager used  the  English  loanword dorai aisu ('dry  ice')  to  name  their  unusual  fruit candy  that  consists  of  a  hard  outside  shell  for  freshness  enclosing  a  dry  ice powder.  I will present  other  similar  cases from  the  realms  of  sight  (colour), taste  (food),  hearing  (music), and  touch  (sex). Thus,  this  chapter  examines one  particular  mechanism,  or  device,  of  this  innovation  in  light  of  current linguistic  and  anthropological  thinking  on  classification.

I will present in more detail the  'modal sensation hypothesis', and  describe a  mechanism  by  which  Japanese  handles  non-dominant  or  non-basic sensations. Japanese  examples of this claim, for all the senses, are given in  the following  section. Japanese  sensory synaesthesia will then  be  discussed  in  the last  section.  I will  conclude  this  chapter  with  a  few  brief  comments  about Japanese being representative of linguistic processes common  to all languages.

## English  loanwords  as Japanese  sensational  experiences

As mentioned,  I  first  became  interested  in  loanwords  while  examining  how English  colour  terms  are  used  in Japanese.  Later,  I began  investigating  how English  loanwords are also used extensively in packaged  and processed  foods. I found  what I thought were some interesting similarities in how they are  used in  both  contexts.  Many  of  the  same  sociolinguistic  strategies  seen  in  the domain  of colour  nomenclature  are  also applied  to  foods.

As I mentioned  in  Chapters  8 and  9, many  of  my Japanese  informants would invent new English  'colour'  terms when asked to name unusual  colours that  they  could  not  easily  name.  Instances  of  this  included  terms  such  as howaito-buruu ('white  blue')  or peeru-paapuru ('pale  purple'). These  are  terms that,  I think,  are  rarely used  by other Japanese  people. That  is, in  the  face  of an  ambiguous  perceptual  event,  English  loanwords  -  as  a  sort  of  default option  - were chosen  to describe  it.

Likewise,  in Japanese  packaged  food,  English  is often  used  to  describe peculiar  tastes, textures, or uses. As an  example, consider  Sakuma  Company's Sankan Haabu Nodo Ame ('Sankan-Orange Herb Throat Candy'; sankan = a  kind of  orange; nodo = 'throat'; ame = a  traditional Japanese  wheat  candy; heebu = ' herb').  It  uses Ekinasea + Haabu Ekisu Haigool ('A  combination of Echinacea

plus  the Essence  of Herbs',  ekinasea =  ' e c h i n a c e a ' ; ekisu  = 'essence  or ' e x r t a c t ' ; haigooo = ' mixture'  or  'combination').  The  packaging  is given  below:

This  product  is for  those  who  want  to  smooth  their  throats,  but  it can  be  taken by anyone.  It is a  hard  candy  that  is dried  syrup  of a blend  of  twenty-one  herbs, combined  with  echinacea.

Another  example  is  seen  in  Eitaro's Anmitsu Jhhj&amp;'D  (Kuromitsu H&lt;£o) summer  treat:  a  'brown-sugared  red-bean  paste'  fruit  cup.  The  box  tells  us  in both Japanese  and  English  (exactly  as  punctuated)  that  this  food  is  named:

This  traditional Japanese  sweet, produced  by Eitaro, Inc, since  1857 is made  from  fresh  fruits,  pure  agar, fine  sugar,  and  spring  water

This  use  of  English  is  all  the  more  remarkable  as  foods  such  as anmitsu are typical  summer  snacks  and  desserts,  with  a  long  history.  Thus,  in  the  face  of uncertainty,  ambiguous  colours  were  often easily  n a m e d with English l oanwords  (although  often  informants  could  use Japanese  terms  only  with some  difficulty).  Likewise, what  else  could  you  name  a  candy  with  a  strawberry centre  surrounded  by  a  yoghurt  cube,  like  a  caramel,  besides STRAWBERRY YOGHURT CHOCOLATE as  we  have  seen  in  Chapter  8?

Another  sociolinguistic  strategy  I  found t h a t  J a p a n e s e i n f o r m a n t s employed  was  to  use  English  colour  terms judiciously  for  prestige  effects,  or as  euphemisms.  No  women,  as  I  mentioned,  would  want  to  buy  a  grey  dress that  is nezumi-iro (literally  meaning  'mouse  coloured',  a standard Japanese  term for  'grey'), but  they are  more  than  happy  to wear  one  that  is guree. In  situations such  as  these,  an  English  loanword  colour  term  could  often  be  used  in  place of  a  more  normal  'basic'  colour  term.  In  a  similar  way, while  few  'diet'  foods or  soft  drinks  are  found  in Japan,  'light'  this  and  that  are  everywhere.  This  is because  'diet'  is  often  understood  by Japanese  to  mean  something  negative; dieting  is  thought  to  be  something  that  obese  or  fat  people  must  do,  rather t h a n  something  normal  people  do  as  part  of  a  regular  health  regimen.

I  also  found  that  English  loanwords  can  be  used  as alternative  vocabulary i t e m s ,  or  cover  different s e m a n t i c r a n g e s  from t h e i r native  J a p a n e s e counterparts.  A  perennial  question  in  language-contact and l a n g u a g e borrowing  situations  is  to  what  extent  the  old  indigenous  lexemes  and  new borrowed  items  overlap  in  semantic  space  (Allen,  1986a;  1986b).  I have  argued

240  Japanese English: Language and culture contact

(Stanlaw,  1987a;  1997a)  that  in  many  linguistic  domains  in Japan,  such  as colour  terminology  or  numbers,  the  English  loanwords  and  native Japanese term  label  different  referents.  For  instance, reddo is  not  a  synonym  for aka ('red'),  nor wan for ichi ('one').  I believe similar things may be occurring with foods  or other  domains. For example, almost all informants  told me that  they knew  that  the  English  loanword sutoruberii ('strawberry')  was ichigo in  native Japanese, and  that appuru ('apple')  was ringo. However, most felt that strawberry or sutoruberii were the more appropriate  names for most of the packaged  foods that were used in  the sample  I examined. 2 In  other words, there  may be  some similarities  between  the  semantics  of  native Japanese  terms  and  English loanwords; but  they are  not  synonymous,  and  do  not  mean  exactly the  same thing.

It is possible that the English loanword phenomenon  found  in the  domain of food  is just  the  taste-counterpart  to  the  visual  responses  in  the  domain  of colour.  In Japanese,  there  may be a similar  'linguistic  synaesthesia'  occurring between  these  two domains.  It is not  clear  if  Japanese  gourmets  'taste'  foods named with English loanwords, like BLUE DRY ICE candies, differently  from  those named  with  native  Japanese  terms.  However,  the  connotations and psychological  responses  may  often  be  different,  and  that  alone  might  be enough  to influence  physiological, and  indeed, culinary, response. I will argue in  the  following  sections  that similar kinds  of responses  are  also found  in  the areas  of  hearing,  touch,  smell, and  mental-psychological  states.

## The  modal sensations hypothesis

In every culture-language, there are certain sensations that are somehow  more salient or important  than  others. Backhouse  (1994)  shows us that Japanese  is no exception. Some colours, tones, tastes, flavours, or scents seem  to be  more readily perceived and identified  than others. I will call this the modal  sensations hypothesis. Due  to the  nature  of cross-cultural  research,  and  the  problems  of translating  terms  across  languages,  this  claim  is obviously very difficult  to  be actually established  experimentally.  It may ultimately be  that  such  a  premise is as much  philosophical  as it is empirical.

That said, there is nonetheless qualitative and ethnographic  evidence  that at  least  suggests  this  possibility.  I will  mention  two  cases. Stoller  (1989),  for example,  shows  the  importance  of  certain  tastes  (among  other  things)  in Songhay culture in Niger. A cook's meeting, or not meeting, the  expectations of  how  some  sauce  should  taste  sends  very  clear  messages  to  the  guests  at dinner.  Feld's  (1982)  ethnography  of sound  in  Kaluli  culture  in  Papua  New Guinea shows that particular bird calls permeate  the society, reify  the cycle of life  and  death,  and  become  encoded  in  the  language  and  the  poetry  of  the Kaluli.

It  is probable  that  these  more  salient  percepts  derive  from  at  least  three sources. First,  they may be  highly determined  by human  biology,  physiology, or psychology. Perhaps the best example of this is the universality of the  'basic' colour  terms  discovered  by Berlin  and  Kay  (1969). True  fire  engine  red,  for example, is more readily attended  to, or more easily remembered  and  recalled later,  than  some  pale  or  light  off-red  colour.  This  seems  to  be  true  even  in languages  that  do  not  have actual  names  for  these  basic colours. Berlin, Kay, and  many  other  researchers  in  colour  nomenclature  theory  believe  that  the structure  of  the  eye's  rods  and  cones, and  the way the  brain  processes  these stimuli,  explain  why certain  colours  are  more  salient  than  others.

At the same time, these modal sensations might also be highly  determined by culture. Anyone who has ever sampled  the  real  cuisine  of another  society can  easily attest  to  this. While  human  physiology probably  operates  the  same way in  all  humans,  what  a  Midwestern  American  may consider  spicy  to  the point  of  excess,  a  Pakistani  or  Thai  might  consider  bland  to  the  point  of inedibility.  Likewise, musical  systems differ  radically from  culture  to  culture. Sound forms  that are considered  pleasant  in one  culture  may do  nothing  for someone from  somewhere  else. In Western  music, when  people  start  hearing a  so-called  five-one  cadence winding down,  they know the  end  of the  piece is about to occur and  they get ready for  the appropriate  aesthetic  response. This anticipation  cannot be made, say, if listening to Indonesian  music, where cycles within  cycles are  the  temporal  factor.  For Westerners, almost all classical  and popular music is constructed  on  the same principle  of the  'key': using  certain sounds  gravitating  around  a particular  note  at prescribed  intervals. Thus,  in this way, Bach  and  the  Beastie  Boys have much  in  common,  and  might  even be  heard  as the  same  by those with  no  experience  in  this  idiom.

Finally, sensations  may be  defined  by a combination  of both  culture  and physiology.  For  example,  tactile  sensations,  sex, or  sensations  of  hot  or  cold are undoubtedly highly determined by physiology. However, what is considered to be actually cold, ticklish, or erotic is given a cultural filter.  In fact,  probably no  sensation  is completely  determined  by either just  culture  or just  biology. Yet  some,  like  those  mentioned  above,  seem  to  contain  relatively  equal amounts. 3

## A  means of describing non-modal sensations

While  cultures  may  have  any  number  of  modal  sensations  in  quite  a  few domains, it is clear  that  most stimuli  being  processed  by individuals  are  not of this nature. The  dominant  modal stimuli will stand out and  be most  readily attended  to, but there are many others present which must also be  processed, and  at  times,  socially  described  and  discussed.  Examples  of  these  would  be the  'secondary  colour  terms'  described  by Berlin  and  Kay and  other  colour

theoreticians,  such  as  'olive'  (vs. basic  GREEN),  'blond' (applying  only  to  hair colour),  or  'reddish'  (as  opposed  to  true  RED).  Traditionally,  these  secondary sensations  have  received  less attention  than  the  dominant  or  'basic'  sensations, even  though  they  are  by  far  the  vast  majority  of  stimuli  present.

One  characteristic  of  these  non-dominant  stimuli,  almost  by definition,  is that  there  is usually  less  clear  consensus  on  how  to  describe  them.  Ambiguous colours  (is  this  chip  light  or  pale  blue?),  uncertain  tastes  (was  that  food too bitter  or just  too  spicy?), or  unusual  smells  (was that  aroma  sweet or  pungent?) are  all  examples  of  things  that  are  not  basic  or  modal  sensations.  If  speakers want  to  talk  about  them,  it  is  often  difficult  to  do  so;  they  must  come  with other  devices  than  simply  using  basic  terms  that  everyone  more  readily  agrees upon.

Figure 10.1  depicts  one  possible  model  for  how  these non-modal sensations  might  be  described.

Figure  10.1 A model of non-modal sensory description

<!-- image -->

I  will  discuss  the  general  model  here,  and  give  particular  examples  from t he Japanese  case  in  the  following  section.  Basically,  the  figure  suggests: in  the  face of some special/unusual  property or characteristic of  some sensory  stimulation or perception, speakers  can  use English loanwords to  describe  them,  via  some mechanism  or sociolinguistic  device.

The  first  column  of  Figure  10.1  lists  some  of  these  unusual  properties: ambiguity,  uncertainty,  new  or  prohibited  forms,  marked  or  special  features. The  second  column  gives  examples  of  different  sensory  stimuli:  colours,  food tastes,  musical  styles  or  sounds,  smells,  and  tactile  activities  such  as  sex.  Other phenomenological  experiences  such  as  the  perception  of  time,  space,  heat, or  cold  could  also  be  placed  here.  I  have  also  tentatively  included  here  some t h i n g s  which  are  not,  strictly  speaking,  sensations.  These  include certain emotional  states  (e.g.  anxiety,  sentiment,  moods),  at  least  to  the  extent  that they  are  determined  by  perception.  The  third  column  lists  one particular t e c h n i q u e  -  the  use  of  English  loanwords  -  which Japanese  people  use  to  a great  extent,  to  address  these  anomalous  perceptions.  Other  techniques,  of course,  are  possible,  but  I will  restrict  my  discussion  to  the  use  of  loanwords in  J a p a n e s e .  The  last  column  lists  how  the  English  loanwords  in  the t h i r d column  can  be  utilized  to  accomplish  the  desired  communicative  tasks.  These i n c l u d e  drawing  analogies,  making  metonymic  connections,  inventing  'new' t e r ms  using  loanwords,  or  appealing  to  certain  images  that  loanword t e r ms have.

## Some  other Japanese examples

I  will  now  give  some  examples  of  how  English  loanwords  are  used  in  Japanese to  describe  these  non-modal  sensations.  I will give instances  from  all  the  senses and  a  few  emotional  states.

## Vision

The  best  examples  here  probably  come  from  the  domain  of  colour,  a  domain t h a t  I  have  discussed  at  length  in  Chapter  9  and  in  other  places (Stanlaw, 1987a;  1997a;  2000b).  I  have  previously  mentioned  how  informants  would sometimes  create  new  colour  terms  based  on  English  loanwords  (usually  with no  connection  to  any  native  English  word)  for  non-basic  colours. Other sociolinguistic  devices  include  appealing  to a certain  kind  of imeeji (or  'image') that  term  might  have. For  example,  the  first-class  car  on  the Japanese  National Railways  is  called  a guriin-sha or green  car as  opposed  to  the  more  mundane native Japanese midori  no sharyoo ( ' g r e e n  train  coach'). An  incidental  comment could  be  made  here  about  the  interaction  between  the  senses  and  society.  In t h e  Meiji  Period,  there  were  certainly  first-class,  second-class,  and  third-class coaches  on  the  Japanese  railways.  After  the  Second  World  War,  with t h e American  advocacy  of  egalitarianism,  such  terms  of  'class  consciousness'  were eliminated  from  the  vocabulary  of many  domains.  Still, there  were  people  who preferred  a more  comfortable  morning  train  ride, and  were willing to pay  extra for  it.  H e n c e ,  t h e  appearance  of  the green  car. Green  apparently  conveys

244  Japanese English: Language and culture contact

feelings  of peace and  tranquility. As one rider said, 'It's universal, isn't it? Green is gorgeous  and  peaceful  and  quiet.'

## Taste

I have also mentioned  in Chapter 8 how the ambiguous tastes of certain  snack foods  and  candies in Japan very often  take on  an  English loanword  descriptor. Other  devices  are  used  as  well.  One  other  example  will  probably  suffice: Bourbon's Eburi Baagaa ('Every  Burgers'). Here  a metonymic  connection  (or analogy)  is attempted  between  the  taste  (or  at  least  the  shape)  of  this  snack food  and  another  famous  food,  the  one  stereotypically  most  popular  in America,  the  hamburgers. Japanese Every Burgers are  bite-sized  miniature hamburger-shaped  cookies  made  of  a semi-sweet chocolate patty  covered  with cream as cheese,  and  topped  with  a  'biscuit'  sesame  seed  bun. Although  they may not taste like miniature  Big Mac's, the  connections  between  these  pieces of  candy and  hamburgers  are  intentional  and  obvious. 4

## Hearing

English  loanwords  are  quite  common  in  the  aural  domain.  In  fact,  the  term hiyaringu (from  the  English  'hearing')  is used  to describe  the  abilities one  has in  listening  comprehension,  say in  a foreign  language  laboratory. Hon (from the  English  'phon')  is the Japanese  term  for  'decibel'.  However,  it is in  the realm of musical style that we find English loanwords extensively used  (Stanlaw, 1989;  1990a). When  the new rock and  roll bands became popular in Japan  in the  1960s, the term used to describe them was guruupu saunzu ('group  sounds') (Yoshizawa  and  Ishiwata,  1979).  Most  of  the  new  music  genres  that  have developed  in Japan  are also named  and described  by using English  loanwords. For  example,  in  the  late  1970s, when  singers  and  songwriters  such  as Yazawa Eikichi  and  Yellow  Magic  Orchestra  reacted  against  the  predictable  and teenage-oriented Japanese  pop  and  rock  styles, they  called  their  movement nyuu  myuujikku ('new  music').  (This  is still  one  of  the  most  important  and influential  styles of  Japanese  popular  music today.) CM songus (a  pseudo-loan from  'Commercial  Message song) describe  the  very popular  genre  of  tunes that are used originally in television  advertisements. But beyond  genre  names, current  popular  music song  titles, group  names, and  lyrics are  dominated  by English  loanwords,  even  though  all of  these  are  home-grown,  not  imported, products  (Stanlaw,  1992d;  2000b).

## Touch

The use of English loanwords in the domain of tactile sensation  is most  readily apparent  in  sexual vocabulary.  English  loanword  terms are probably  used  for

at  least  two  reasons.  First,  it  is  often  t he  case  that Japanese  does  not  have  a word  for  a  particular  activity  or  experience (except  for  perhaps  a  clinical  or medical  term).  For  example,  before  borrowing  from  Western  languages  there was  no  term  for  'orgasm'  in Japanese  except  some  indirect  euphemisms  like saikoochoo ('climax'  or  'zenith').  Thus,  the  English  loanword oogasumu at  the very least  fills  a  semantic  void.  Another  reason  for  their  extensive  usage  is  that English  loanwords  are  likely  to  carry  different  semantic  loads  from t h e i r Japanese  counterparts.  For  example,  the  English  loanword fakku ('fuck') can be  frequently  heard,  even  on  occasion  in  academic  contexts.  It  can  be  used both  as  a  n o u n  and  a  verb,  and  occurs  in  compounds,  as  in fakku eiga ('fuck film', or  p o r n o g r a p h i c movies).  I  saw  a  discussion  of  sexual  advice and t e c h n i q u e s  in  a  p o p u l a r  J a p a n e s e  men's  magazine  (the  equivalent  to  the American Esquire or Playboy) a  few  months  ago.  One  of  the  survey  questions was 'Basuto aibu  no pointo wa  doko  daT ('Where  is  it  that  [at  what point] do you  caress  the breast?'). Constance  (1992)  claims  that  (although  I  have  never heard  this  myself)  one  of  the  words  for  female  masturbation  is suicchi  o ireru ('flip  on  the switch'). The  most  common  word  for fellatio is fera, obviously  an English  loanword  (other  English  loanwords,  such  as ooraru sekkusu ('oral  sex'), have  also  become  quite  popular.)

## Olfaction

The  sense  of  smell  is  certainly  one  of  the  underappreciated  senses  among anthropologists  (although  there  have been  studies by Stoller  [1989];  LeGuerer [1994];  and  Classen  et  al.  [1994]).  I  certainly  am  no  exception  in  my  lack  of expertise.  Dorland  (1993)  argues  that  there  are  nine  basic  scents,  and  claims that  olfaction  is similar  to  colour,  being  highly physiological  and  cross-culturally universal.

Japan  might  be  a  culture  that  values  smells  more  than  many  others.  The Japanese  have  long  valued kooryoo (fragrances,  aromatics,  perfumes,  scents) as not  only  one  of  the  senses, but  also  an  art  form.  Although  not  as  well-known as  t h e  famous  Japanese  tea  ceremony,  the koodoo f i j l ('way  of  incense') or incense  appreciating  ceremonies  and  contests  probably  goes  back  to  the  time of  earliest  recorded  history  in Japan (K.  Morita,  1992),  and  are  on  par  with tea  ceremonies  and  formal  poetry  gatherings  in  terms  of  sophistication.  Many Japanese  in  the  United  States  have  told  me  that  they  are  uncomfortable  with having  bath-tubs  and  toilets  together  in  the  same  room  for  reasons  of  odour and  visual  aesthetics.

Unsurprisingly,  English  loanwords  are  also  found  in  this  domain,  as  in sumooku  suru (for  example,  'to smoke [say,  a  salmon  or  squid]').  However,  one of  the  problems  with  researching  olfaction  is  that  smell  and  taste  are often conflated  (anyone  with  a cold  knows  the  importance  of  the  nose  in  identifying foods).  It  is  therefore  difficult  to  make  separate  comments  about  scent  from those  made  previously  about  food.

## Emotions,  mental-psychological  states,  and  other  sensations  and  percepts

There  are  a  few  comments  I would  like  to  make  about  emotional  states  and ot h e r  sensations t h a t are not strictly  part of t h e five classical senses. Psychological  conditions  might  also  be  considered  sensations,  at  least  to  some degree.  For  example,  shaking  from  being  scared  is a  sensation  resulting  from a  stimulus;  it  is  a  sensory  reaction  to  strong shock  (shokku) or  fright.  These psychological  states are  often  described  using  English  loanwords.  For  example, an  overly  sentimental  person  who  weeps  over  something  is called uetto ('wet'). The  opposite,  one  who  is  rather  rational  and  unemotional,  is dorai (' d r y ' ) . Someone  who  is muudii ('moody')  is not  necessarily  nasty  or  ill-tempered,  but j u s t  s o m e o n e  'full  of  m o o d ' ,  either  extremely  good  or  bad.

## Synaesthesia 'in  the  realm of  the  senses'

Before  the  fifteen  minutes  of fame  of  John  Wayne  Bobbit,  in  1976  controversial avant  garde Japanese  film  director  Ohshima  Nagisa  released  his Ai  no  Koriida, known  in  the  West  as In  the Realm  of the Senses. Famous  for  its  explicitness,  the film  was based  on  a  true  incident  of  strangulation  and  castration  in  the  1930s. Visually  stunning,  and  still very  popular,  the  film  seems  to  imply  that  there  is an  underlying  strain  of  subliminal  sensuality  running  through  Japanese aesthetics  and  culture. A case, at  least  a linguistic  one,  might  be  made  for  such a  claim,  considering  the  plethora  of Japanese  nature  terms  or  the  thousands of  expressions  of  onomatopoeia.  So  in  terms  of  making  sensory  metaphors,  it might  be  expected  that  this  'empire  of signs'  in  its  'realm  of  the  senses'  would do  so  often,  and  with  ease.

In  addition,  I  would  suggest  that  perception  and  sensation i n f l u e n c e Japanese  in  other  ways as well. Synaesthesia,  in  its classical sense, is the  blending of  stimuli  from  two  different  domains.  For  example,  the jazz  musician  who can  'hear'  colours  or  the  painter  who  'sees'  a  picture  when  she  or  he  attends a  s y mphony  presumably  is  experiencing  synaesthesia.  As  in  all  cultures, metaphors  and  synaesthesia  abound  in Japanese,  and  English  loanwords  are often  involved.  For  example,  one  of  the  packaged  candies  that  is  popular  in Japan  is  called Flower's Kiss  Candy, written  in  English  in  roman  letters.  Inside t he  package  there  are  individually  wrapped  pieces  of milk  sumomo  (milk or [or creamy]  damson  plum  or  prune)  in  the  following  flavours: rose, apricot blossom, and double  cherry  blossom. T h e  emphasis  seems  to  be  on  creating  a  taste  that approximates  the  scent  of  a  flower  rather  than  the  taste  of  a  fruit.

According  to  Ikegami ( 1 9 8 2 ) , this  p h e n o m e n o n of  synaesthetic or metaphor  in Japanese  is based  upon  the  way the  human  senses  are  structured. This  arrangement  is  shown  in  Figure  10.2.  Ikegami  believes  that  these  also approximate  an  evolutionary  ordering  of  'high'  senses  to  'low'  senses.  Little

evidence  exists  to  actually  support  this,  but  the  overall  ordering  is  still  of interest.  Of  course, metaphors  in Japanese  are  made  all the  time  in  all  these senses, such  as hageshii honoo no yoo na koi ('a  love  like  an  ardent  flame'),  and so on.  But  instead  of just  comparing  something  sensory  (like  a visual  flame) to  something  concrete  or  abstract  (like  love),  metaphors  can  also  be synaesthetic. In such  a case, one  expression  is associated with one  sense, while another  is also  associated  with  a sense  (rather  than  something  abstract). An example, consisting of two expressions from  the same kind of sensory  domain, could  be akarui  iro (a  'bright  colour'), where  both  parts  are  associated  with the  vision.  Likewise,  a yakamashii  koe (a  'noisy voice')  connects  two  auditory senses.

| iro no haamonii         | colour                                                      | hearing                       |                               | vision                        |

Sometimes  expressions  can  be  made  connecting  two  different  senses.  For example,  consider  a  well-known haiku by  the  famous  poet  Bashoo:

| uguisu ya     | the Bush Warbler         |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| ki-iro-na koe | with a yellow voice/call |
| oya-o yobu    | calls for its parents    |

Here  a  connection  is made  between  'yellow'  (a visual  sensation)  and  voice  (an auditory  sensation).  Likewise,  an  expression  like shibui  iro ('a  sour,  astringent colour')  connects  something  from  the  realm  of  taste  with  the  realm  of  vision. Ikegami  believes  that  normal  synaesthetic  metaphors  can  be  made  between expressions  from  down  to  top  in  Figure  10.2. That  is, sensory  expressions  like taste  can  modify  those  of  smell,  sight,  or  hearing;  touch  can  modify  taste,  and so  on.  Auditory  and  visual  expressions  can  modify  each  other.  So  Bashoo's 'yellow voice'  would  be  a  normal  and  expected  synaesthetic  metaphor.  Some other  examples  might  be  those  given  in  Table  10.1. Anecdotally,  these  also seem  to  hold  in  English.

But  we  are  not  restricted  to  constructing  only  expressions  of  the  above type. We  can  make  expressions  such  as buraito na  aji (or akarui aji) for 'bright taste',  taking  the  form  of  vision  - &gt;  taste  (top  to  down).  The  actual  meaning of  this  phrase  is probably  not  very  clear.  However,  we  most  likely would  think t h a t  it  is  certainly  m o r e  pleasant  tasting  than daaku na  aji or kurai aji ('dark taste',  t h o u g h  saying daaku chokoreeto ( ' d a r k  chocolate') has  a daaku teesuto ('dark  taste'  might  be  an  exception).  We  are  also  certain  that  it  is  something new  and  different. It  is  for  t hese  reasons  that  advertisers  like  to  use  such expressions.  To  add  to  the  attraction,  English  loanwords  are  also  often used in  these  contexts.  For  example,  to  return  once  again  to  the  very  popular catch phrase ('jingle')  described  in  Chapter  2, in  the  Coca  Cola  advertising  campaign t he  t h e m e  was sawayaka, teisuti,  I feel  Coke! ('refreshing, tasty,  I feel  coke'). Here we  see  some  'normal'  synaesthetic  comparisons  being  made  (touch  or  taste  -

-&gt; taste in sawayaka -&gt; tasty). But we also see taste going down  to touch  (i.e. taste -&gt; touch)  when tasty modifies I feel Coke (T  feel  a  Coke',  or  T want  to have  a Coke').  Of  course,  the  ambiguity  in  these  English  phrases  makes  the slogan  much  more  effective.

## Classification,  categorization,  and  English  in Japanese

Although  not every cognitive scientist or anthropologist would agree, I believe that  symbols,  senses,  and  cognition  are  inexorably  linked.  Some  cognitive scientists,  however,  are  indeed  interested  in  making  such  connections  (e.g. Lakoff  and Johnson  [1999], Lakoff  and  Nunez  [2000]). In  this section  I will try  to  tie  these  issues  together  in Japanese  via an  English  context.

The classical theory of categorization,  based on  the notion  that things  are grouped  together  on  the basis of what they have in common,  has  increasingly come under  attack  in  recent  decades. That  is, under  the  old  theory,  category membership  is  determined  by  claiming  that  all  members  share  a  certain number  of  'necessary  and  sufficient  features'  needed  to  define  the  class. However, while  all winged,  feathered,  flying  creatures  may be  'birds',  some birds  are  better  representatives  than  others.  Thus,  linguists,  philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists, and  others interested  in cognition  now believe that  best  examples,  or  prototypes,  play  a  large  part  in  our  processes  of determining  category  membership.

Lakoff  (1987)  and  others argue  that the problem  of determining  category membership  could  be  thought  of as consisting of four  parts:

1. concrete  basic  objects  which  have  names  ('linguistic  labels')
2. things  that  are  included  in  the  above-named  category  ('extensions') that are  not  basic  objects
3. connections between  the basic objects and  the extensions  through  various cognitive  or  sociolinguistic  devices, such  as metaphor  or  metonymy.
4. a  theory  of  motivations  which  allows  for  these  connections  between extension  and  basic object  to  occur

This  is an  oversimplification  of  a very  complex  argument,  but  according  to Lakoff  (1987), Werner,  and  others,  there  is some  sort  of  reason  why  people can  apply  the  name  of a basic level category  to an  extension.  That  is, calling something a 'cup' entails a whole  (albeit)  unspoken  theory of 'cupness'. Thus, we can  get  a  'cup'  of  coffee  from  McDonald's,  even  though  the  container  is styrofoam  and  has  no  handle, because  in  many native  English  speakers' view of  the  world,  hot  drinks  come  in  cups.  Such  a  rationale  could  be  called  a ' motivated  convention'.  It  is  important  to  notice  how  these  motivated conventions  differ  from  others,  namely  completely  productive  universalist conventions,  and  arbitrary  unpredictable  one.

## Plastic  cups and  paper glasses

To  give  an  example  of  the  discussion  above  using  English  loanwords  in Japanese,  consider  the  following  very interesting  experiments  conducted  by Kronenfeld  (1996)  among  native  Hebrew  speakers,  English  speakers,  and Japanese  speakers.  For  the Japanese  part  of  the  experiments,  twenty-one Japanese  students  taken  from  an  ESL class at  the  University  of  California  at Riverside were asked  about  names for  thirty-five  items which  might be  called 'drinking vessels' in  English  (a set of mugs, cups, and  glasses of various sizes, shapes, and  materials).  'Prototypical'  objects  (that is, the  best exemplars  of a domain)  were elicited, and  then  informants  were asked  to sort the  items  into groups  based  on  how similar  they  thought  they  might  be.  Informants  were then  asked  to  label  these  grouped  categories  into which  they had  put  items. Multidimensional  scaling  was  used  to  quantitatively  determine  degree  of similarity  of sorting  by item  and  informant.

Three  overriding terms for drinking vessels for  these Japanese  informants appeared: koppu, kappu and gurasu. Figure  10.3  (modified  from  Kronenfeld, 1996)  shows  how  the  informants  in  this  experiment  divided  up  this  domain of things to drink out of. That is, what English speakers might call coffee  mugs, metal  cups  and  tea  cups, were  categorized  as kappu in Japanese.  Tumblers, large and small paper cups, styrofoam  cups, restaurant glasses, 'regular'  glasses, and paper cups with handles were catalogued as koppu. Things like wine glasses were classified  as gurasu.

In terms of ideals, Kronenfeld  found  from  his statistics that the  prototypical glass was an  English  'brandy  snifter'; glasses for  this  group  of  informants  are something with stems  (an attribute of shape). Cups (kappu) for  these Japanese were similar  to  'cups'  in  English,  except  that  more  emphasis was put  on  the presence  of a handle  as the  defining  feature. Koppu are  all  the  vessels  made of non-traditional  materials. Cylindrical  shape  seems  to be  the  most  defining attribute for  this group. The  exemplar koppu was a non-disposable  plastic cup.

However, it is important to note that all three of these terms are  loanwords (although  Kronenfeld  did  not  pay  much  attention  to  this  fact,  as  he  was concerned  in making a different  kind of argument). The earliest of the  three is koppu; it  probably  came  from  Portuguese copo around  the  1670s,  although Dutch kopwas extant in the islands at this time as well  (Arakawa,  1977). Gurasu (from  the  English  'glass',  although  German  and  Dutch  may  have  been competing forms)  was apparently first used by Fukuzawa Yukichi  (see  Chapter 3)  in  1876, at  least  in  written  form  (Arakawa,  1977). The  term kappu (from the  English  'cup')  made  its first appearance  in  the  1880s  (Arakawa,  1977). It became  much  more  popular,  apparently,  after  the  Second  World  War.

The  notion  of  motivations  versus  attributes  is easily seen  if we  examine things  in  more  detail.  Kronenfeld's  data  takes  on  more  depth  if we look  at (1)  what kind  of term  is being used  (i.e. an  English  loanword), and  (2)  when

P

Figure  10.3  Japanese  drinking vessels

and  how it is being used. While  there  is a fair  degree  of indeterminacy  in  the usage  of  English  'cup',  'mug',  or  'glass'  by native  English  speakers, Japanese has some  ambiguity as well. There  are  at least several  dimensions  that  can  be used  to  decide  which  term  is  appropriate  at  a  given  time.  One  is  the temperature  of  the  liquid.  The  informants  to whom  I have  talked  about  this say cold  items  (e.g. milk, water,  Cokes)  tend  to  go  in glasses while  hot  items (e.g. koohii [coffee],  koocha  [Japanese  'Western'  tea], cocoa [hot  chocolate]) go in cups. Others say height is a factor; glasses are tall, cups are short, and koppu are  in  between.

Materials that go inside the vessel are also important: alcohol almost always goes  in glasses (e.g. beer,  wine, whisky, champagne). Tea  and  coffee  go  in cups, and  other  things  like juice,  milk,  Coke, or water  go in koppu. However,  some say it  is not just  any  coffee  that  can  go  in  a cup: only American-style  weaker coffee;  Vienna  coffee  or  Kenyan  coffee  usually go  in  a kaapu. Hot  soups  and hot milk have to go into a mug (magu). Most loanword and regular  dictionaries say it is the  handle  that  is important  (which  is why trophy prizes are  also cups in Japanese). Some say it is level of elegance or detachment from  the  mundane that  determines  usage: glass sounds sophisticated  while koppu is very  ordinary.

1.0

Then  there  are  the  numerous  special  cases: mejaa  kappu (measuring  cup;  also keiryoo kappu is  used,  using  the  native Japanese  term  for  'measure' keiryoo), kami  koppu (literally  'paper' koppu: or  ' p a p e r  cup'),  or  the  ubiquitous kappu raamen (cup  of  instant  ramen)  or kappu  nuudoru ('cup  noodle',  a cup  of  instant noodles).  Finally  there  is  inter-informant  ambiguity  and i n t r a - i n f o r m a n t variability.  Water (mizu) can  go  in  both koppu and glasses, and kora (Pepsis  and Cokes)  can  go  in  both glasses a n d koppu. 5

The  important  point  to  keep  in  mind  through  all  this,  however,  is  that these  terms,  although  by  now  quite  nativized,  are  English,  and  carry  many  of t h e  c onnotations  that  loanwords  and  such  already  carry.  Choice,  then,  cannot simply  be  relegated  to  attribute  (shape,  size,  handles,  etc.).  Instead,  a  whole vast  array  of  collective  social  forces  and  individual  creative  motivations  are  at play  in  such  a  seemingly  simple  task  as choosing  a label  for  a  container.  These issues  will  appear  again  in  the  rest  of  this  chapter.

## Reasoning and rabbits

In  transformational  grammar  (TG)  or  government  and  binding  theory,  or  even most  of  the  other  mainstream  theories  in  autonomous  linguistics,  for t h a t matter,  there  is  great  concern  with  'universals'  of  all  kinds.  This  means  that they  are  most  concerned  with  phenomena  that  are  completely ' p r o d u c t i v e ' and  therefore  ultimately  totally  predictable.  These  are  often  thought  to  lie  in t h e  r e a l m  of  the  physical  structure  of  the  environment  or  the biological structure  of  the  human  mind.  Examples  of  this might  be  the  TG  grammarians' search  for  universal  grammar,  or  the  evolutionary  colour  sequence posited by  the  anthropologists  Berlin  and  Kay.

Earlier,  structural  linguists  and  functional  anthropologists,  on  the  other hand,  were  convinced  that  much  of  human  behaviour  was  simply  'arbitrary' and  therefore  largely  unpredictable.  Many  of  the  Sapir-Whorf  arguments  were presented  in  this  rhetoric.  In  fact,  colour  terminology  was  taken  as one  of  the best  examples  of  how  language-cultures  can  divide  up  a  domain  in  hundreds of  different  arbitrary  ways. A  motivated  convention  is something  less  strong; it  shows  how  an  extension  can  make  sense  and  explain  why  people  use  it,  but it  c a n n o t  say  that  it will  always  happen.  As an  example  which  has  now  become somewhat  famous  among  linguists  and  cognitive  scientists,  Lakoff  shows  how ' women',  'fire',  and  'dangerous  things'  such  as  spears  are  put  into  the  same noun  category  by  Dyirbal  Australians.  The  process  works  like  this:  Basically t h e  world  is  divided  into  two  domains,  males  and  females.  In  Dyirbal  myth, t h e  first  husband  was  the  moon  and  the  first  wife  was  the  sun.  Thus,  women get  associated  with  the  sun,  and  hence,  with  fire.  Fire  itself  is  painful and dangerous,  so dangerous  things are  in  turn  associated  with  this  category.  Thus, t h e  association  of  woman,  fire,  and  dangerous  things  exists  for  some  reason,

and  is not  completely  arbitrary.  However,  there  is also  no  way to  produce  a rule which  would  predict  ahead  of time  that  they would  all be  so  grouped.

An  example  from Japanese  is counting  rabbits.  Most  adult Japanese,  at least  theoretically,  will count  rabbits using  the  classifier wa, the  counter  used to refer  to birds. Why is this? One  interpretation  might be as follows  (although not  every informant  agrees  completely with  the  analysis  given  here): At  first glance  the  grouping of rabbits together with all different  kinds of birds  seems to be  a freak  of linguistic  nature  or an  historical  accident.  It is neither. At  the time of the introduction  of Buddhism  in Japan,  the usual prescriptions  against eating  animals  (i.e.  'four-legged  creatures')  were  also  imported.  After  some time, however, legend  has it that Buddhist  monks wanted  to eat  the  plentiful and  common  rabbits  (or  perhaps  were  used  to  eating  them  already).  Thus, they  decided  that  rabbits  only  have  two  legs  (because  they  hop),  and  could therefore  be eaten without violating Buddhist dietary taboos. Thus, to this day, rabbits are counted  as birds, using the counter wa (Stanlaw and  Inoue,  1994).

## Language  and  symbolic  change:  Symbol  creation  and  use

Many,  if  not  the  majority,  of  the  symbols  in  a  language  or  culture  remain relatively  static.  Indeed,  a  certain  amount  of  'symbol  stasis'  is necessary  for culture  to  adequately  function and  for  communication  to  take  place. Obviously, at the same time too, symbolic change is also necessary to a culture, if nothing else, just to keep par with the inevitable physical and  environmental changes  which  occur.  However,  what  we  often  call  'symbolic  change'  in  a language  or  culture  really involves  at  least  three  or  four  logical  possibilities, as outlined  in Table  10.2.

Table  10.2 Types  of symbolic  change

|                                                                                                                | symbol element                                | symbol features                               |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| symbol stasis symbol replacement symbol redefinition/ modification symbol innovation (creation or importation) | stays the same changes stays the same changes | stays the same stays the same changes changes |

First, in what we might call  'symbolic replacement',  the  meaning  features of  a  symbol  can  remain  the  same  while  the  symbolic  element  or  label  is replaced.  Thus,  if it  is true  that  the  native Japanese  colour  term momo-iro is

being replaced  by the English  loanword pinku, then  this would be an  example of this first kind of change. Theoretically, all the physical-perceptual  properties of momo-iro, as well  as  all  the  feelings  of  affect,  would  be  taken  over  by  the new symbol pinku. Also, pinku would  have to be a completely free  symbol itself initially,  and  should  not  bring  into  the  system  any new or  outside  features.

The  second  way the  system  might  change  is through  the  attribution  of new  meaning  features  onto  an  old  symbol.  We  might  call  this  'symbol replacement',  or  'symbol  modification',  or  'symbolic  readjustment'.  This may be  the  most  common  kind  symbolic change, and we can  see it all the  time  as old word  items  take  on  new meanings  (e.g.  'gay',  the  swastika,  etc.).

The  third  type  of  symbolic  change,  also  common,  might  be  called 'symbolic  innovation'.  In  this  case,  a  new  symbol  is  introduced  into  the symbolic inventory of a language or culture, and a new set of attributes  applied to it. These new symbols could be either created locally or borrowed from  some other  source. The  following  example,  using  the  enhanced-feature  approach of motivated  conventions  shows how this might  come  about.

## Purple,  Part  1: Dancing  in  the park,  and  dancing  in  the  dark

As we have seen in Chapter  2, from  the early 1980s to mid-1990s, among  some Tokyo-area  teenagers  a new dancing  fad  had  been  quite  popular.  Hordes  of young people, dressed in a variety of outlandish  costumes, would go to a park bordering  on  a fashionable  chic area of the  city and  dance  to American  rock and  roll  music  of the  1950s. The  dancers  usually moved  in  unison  while  in  a group of about a dozen people, listening to music playing from  a large  portable stereo  tape  deck  placed  in  the  centre  of  the  street. Although  such  spectacles have  now largely disappeared,  for  many years on  any given  Sunday  (the  one day such  events  occur),  there  may have been fifty to a hundred  such  groups dancing  in  the  park.

Although  these  teenagers  put  on  quite  a  spectacular  free  show  every Sunday  and  always attracted  large  crowds  of  tourists,  mainstream  Japanese people, including most other non-participating teenagers, seemed to have litde respect  for  them.  First,  these  people  were  at  that  crucial  age  in  the Japanese educational  system when  they should  be  home  cramming  for  the  university entrance  exams. Mainstream  teenagers would  have no  time  to waste  Sunday after  Sunday making spectacles of themselves in public. But in some ways these were  people who were no longer part of the Japanese  dream. As one  21-yearold boosoo-zoku informant  once  mentioned  to me, he  knew six or seven  years ago  that  he  was not  going  to  go  to  a good  high  school,  so  that  he  could  get into  a  good  university  and  get  a job  at  a  good  company  and  become  a successful sarariiman ('white  collar  worker',  generally  with  a large  firm).  He was  then  unloading  trucks  and  found  support  and  companionship  with motorcycle  gang  members.

Secondly,  these  non-conformists  are  somehow  perceived  as a threat  to mainstream Japanese  society. Hardly a day goes by without someone  in  the popular  media  decrying  the  new  youthful  decadence  and  the  young people's  lack  of  respect  for  traditional  moral  values.  The  various -zoku ('groups'  or  'gangs')  are  often  cited  as prime  examples.  Many  of  them  are indeed  sometimes  noisy,  impolite,  and  bothersome.  For  some  reason,  the colour  purple  has  generally  become  associated  with  some  of  these  groups, especially for  female  members. Many motorcycle  bikers wear flowing  purple scarves as they fly down  the  narrow  side  streets just  missing dogs,  children, and  old  people.  Many  of  the  colours  of  the  various  tribes  of takenoko-zoku (literally  'bamboo-shoot  gang')  dancers  in  the  parks  are  also  purple  or purplish-pink. 6

In  any case, a  new word  had  been  introduced  into  the  current Japanese vocabulary  in  the  1980s: paapurin, from  the  English  loanword  colour  term purple  and  the  English -ing gerund  form.  This word  means  to be  bad,  to  be annoying, to create a nuisance, to be 'purple'. 7 Now making verbal puns using English  morphemes  is not unusual  in Japanese. For example, a few years  ago Japan  Railways used  the word training -  a combination  of the  English  word 'train'  and  '-ing'  form  - in  one  of its popular  advertising  campaigns.  In  this case,  by adding  the  English  -mgform  to  the  English  loanword  colour  term, the Japanese  seem  to  be  emphasizing  that  those  persons  are  literally  being ' purple'  (that  is, being  silly or  foolish). 8

The  English  loanword paapurin is  quite  interesting  for  several  reasons. Firstly, most English  loanwords which are  taken  into Japanese  are  nouns,  and they  generally  behave  as  nouns  in  the  host  language  (although  they  may sometimes  follow  a  productive Japanese  grammatical  pattern  and  take  the Japanese  verbalizing  suffix suru to  become  verbal,  as in tenisu suru; literally 'to  do  tennis'  or  'to play tennis'). However,  'purpling',  certainly is not a  noun in  English  (or  is questionable  at  best).  However,  in Japanese paapurin may sometimes show some nominal  characteristics.

Secondly,  the  English  loanword paapurin is created  by taking an  English -mg-form  and  adding  to  it a word  ('purple')  that  does  not  usually  take  this grammatical  form  in  English.  Creating  loanwords  in  this  manner  is rare  in Japanese, and  the only other times I have heard such constructions have  been in jokes  (e.g. shaberingu, or  'to  be  a  chatterbox',  from  the Japanese  verb shaberu, 'to  chatter  or gab' plus the nativized form  of the English -ing ending). However,  because  the -ingiorm is one  of  the  earliest  constructions  learned in  English  classes,  the  majority  of Japanese  people  know  the  grammatical meaning  of  such  words:  'We  can  enjoy  playing  these  kinds  of  games  .  . . playing with  language  like  this  is an  intellectual  game.'

Thirdly,  this  is  a  completely  new  and  unique  way of  using  an  English loanword  colour  term  in Japanese. Other English loanword  colour terms have been used metaphorically  (e.g. as in reddo hotto sekkusu, 'red  hot sex'), but  they

usually  carry  at  least  some  of  the  connotations  that  were  found  originally  in English. 9 Fourthly,  as far  as  I  know,  this  English  loanword  had  no  origin  at  all in  the  popular  media  or  in  advertising  (which  may be  unexpected  by the  many c o m m e n t a t o r s who  believe  that  English l o a n w o r d s  breed in s u c h an environment).  Finally,  we  can  note  that  even  though  this  form, ' p u r p l i n g ' , seems  to  be  nominal,  this  loanword  apparently  has  great  flexibility.  It can  even be  inflected  like  a  normal Japanese  n&lt;z-adjective (keiyoo-dooshi) (e.g.  compare Kare-wa paapurin da  mon, 'Boy,  he  is  really  "purpling"  / "He  is  really  d u m b "  ' with paapurin-na koto shita, ' He  really  did  a  "purple"  thing"  / ' He  created  quite a  nuisance').

The  way  a  new  symbol  might  be  created  by  using  English  loanwords  is outlined  in  Table  10.2. Each  of  three  original  concepts  in Japanese:  (1) boosoozoku motorcyclists  who  wear  purple  scarves;  (2)  the  English  loanword  colour t e r m paapuru; and  (3)  an  attitude  towards  English  and  America  (perhaps  one that  all Japanese  students  have  been  exposed  to  in  school)  have  some  of  their possible  features  listed.  Note  that  some  of  the  features  of  one  concept or symbol  are  actually  symbols  themselves.  These  features  (i.e. symbols)  under  a concept  can  then  in  turn  draw  their  own  subsequent  features  into  the  set  of this  first  concept.  An  example  of  this  is seen  in  Figure  10.4 where  the  feature ' English  loanword'  is listed  under  the  symbol paapuru.

Now,  many  of  the  associations  that  English  loanwords  have  in  general  can be  brought  into  the  feature  list of  paapuru. Note, that  these feature ' definitions' are  not  closed.  People  can  add  to  them  as they see fit or  ignore  certain  features if  r e q u i r e d  or  desired.  Likewise,  concepts,  in  turn,  define  other  concepts.  For example,  the  folk  theory  of  who  is  thought  to  be  a boosoo-zoku a n d  why,  is usually  far  richer  than  any  single  symbol  or  list  of  its  possible  features.

The  new  symbol, paapurin, arises  by  making  a  connection  with features from  several  original  or  established  symbols. For  example,  the  hue  dimension comes  from  the  English  loanword  colour  term,  the  idea  of  being  a  public nuisance  comes  from boosoo-zoku which  includes  the  purple  hue  in its definition,  and  the  notion  of  being  special  probably  comes  from  all  three symbols. Apart from  features  of metaphor  and  connotation,  note  also  that  even formal  morphological  features  might  be  contributed  by each  symbol,  such  as t he  root  from  the  colour  term  and  the  final  -mgform  from  English.  Although I  have  not  heard paapurin-zoku ('the  purpling  tribe'),  I would  be  surprised  if this  obvious  connection  were  not  soon  made.

## Purple, Part 2:  Vantage theory,  categorizations, and motivations

The  cognitive  anthropologist  Robert  MacLaury  has developed  a  theory 7 of  how humans  categorize  the world  and  apprehend  experience which  he  calls vantage t h e o r y (MacLaury,  1992;  1995;  1997;  2002;  Taylor  and  MacLaury, 1995).

Vantage  theory  incorporates  some  of  the  formal  aspects  of  classification  with t he  social  variable  of  sociolinguistics,  and  provides  a  new  and  important  way of  looking  at  problems  of  denotation  versus  connotation,  metaphor, and t h e o r i e s  of  categorization.  As  the  use  of  English  in Japanese  is  inexorably connected  to  all  these  things,  and  because  vantage  theory  has  been  used  to examine  English  loanword  colour  terms,  it  merits  discussion  at  this  point.

In  1997  MacLaury  wrote  a  new  book  on  the  colour  terminology  systems found  in  100  Mexican  and  Central  American  languages.  This  is  a  ground› breaking  study  on  how  the  human  mind  apprehends  the  physical  universe, and  is the  most  important  work  on  colour  nomenclature  theory  to appear  since Berlin  and  Kay's  study  thirty  years  ago.  MacLaury's  colour  research  began  in t h e  1970s  at  the  University  of  California,  working  with  Berlin  and  Kay  on several  studies  in  Latin  America.  Eventually,  Berlin  and  Kay  along  with researchers  at  the  Summer  Institute  of  Linguistics finished the  World  Colour Survey, an  investigation  of  111  'exotic'  languages  in Asia, Africa,  the  Americas, New  Guinea  and  Australia,  while  MacLaury  and  his  co-workers  finished t h e

Meso-American  Colour  Survey, an  investigation  of  116 languages  in  Mexico and  Guatemala.  These  two vast studies,  together  with  MacLaury's  later  work in the Pacific Northwest, have now provided a sufficiendy  large and  comparable set  of  data  to  allow for  the  analysis of  the  intricacies  of colour  nomenclature in  great  detail. MacLaury's  recent  book  (1997)  was the first attempt  at such  a broad  synthesis.

## Co-extension: A new semantic  relation

MacLaury attempted  to do many brilliant  things in  his Meso-American  study, and only a few high points can be described  here. Perhaps the most  important discussion  for  linguists  and  cognitive  scientists - as well as  anthropologists, obviously - is his interpretations  of the  processes  of human  categorization. MacLaury  examines  in  depth  the  semantic  relation  of  'co-extension',  an association  'that  did  not fit our  preconceptions  of synonymy, near  synonymy, inclusion,  or  complementation'  (1997:  111). During  the  course  of  his  field investigations,  MacLaury  and  others  found  that  informants  would  often  use different  words  to  label  the  same  colour.  That  in  itself,  of  course,  is  not surprising,  as anyone  researching  colour  nomenclature  in  the  field  can  tell you; but  informants  would  sometimes  use  these  two terms in  rather  peculiar ways that  would  only  become  apparent  in  mapping  tasks. As an  example  (I do  not  mean  to  imply  here  that  this  analogy  actually  applies  to  the  basic English colour  term system), let us assume that a native English speaker  labels the  same  several  dozen  colour  chips presented  to  them  individually as  either TAN or KHAKI, with maybe  KHAKI being also applied  to a few more  colours.

From  a naming  point  of view, it appears  that  the  two terms  either  label the  same  category  (with  T A N or  KHAKI being  used  in  free  variation),  or  that TAN is included  within  the  KHAKI category.  However,  if we asked  informants to do a mapping task such as those discussed in Chapter 9  (see Table 9.3), we might  find  that  some  of  these  terms  are  hardly  synonyms.  Figure  10.5, displaying  the  brownish  colours  from  the  Berlin  and  Kay larger  array,  shows the  condition just  described.  That  is, this  informant  seems  to  label  most  of the  shaded  chips  in  the  chart  as either  T A N or  K H A K I (with just  a few  colours in  the  C or  D rows only being  called  KHAKI).

However,  a  step-wise  mapping  task  (where  informants  are  asked  to delineate which colours in the array of chips belong to some colour term,  and are  then  asked  to  do  so successively  in  several  steps  until  there  are  no  more chips which  correspond  to the  label)  might  reveal  that  this informant  places different  attention  to  each  term.  For  instance,  K H A K I terms  might  centre around  a light yellowish  chip  and  disseminate  outward  from  it  (as shown  in Figure  10.5, Part  2). Likewise, the  TAN colours might be focused  around  some darker  brown  colour  chip  and  proceed  from  there  (as shown  in  Figure  10.5, Part 3). Thus, the name of some particular colour category is contingent  upon

<!-- image -->

t he  point  of  view  or  perspective  taken  by  an  informant.  If  the  informant  calls t h e  category  KHAKI, he  or  she  is  coming  at  it  from  the  light  or  yellowish  side and  extending  it  down  into  the  darker  brownish  TANS. If  it  is  called  TAN,  the category  focuses  around  some  ideal  tan-ish  colour  and  extends  upwards towards  the  yellows. This  is not  a  mere  case  of  two  terms  simply  being  applied to  the  same  referents;  presumably  the  two  experiences  are,  psychologically  or experientially,  somewhat different.

## Vantages

While  this  type  of  p h e n o m e n a  is found  in  many  of  the  world's  languages,  it  is especially  prevalent  in  the  Meso-American  WARM  (red  and  yellow) category, where  most  of  these  colours  are  used  co-extensively.  The  ethnography  and formal  experiments  clearly  demonstrate  that  co-extension  in  this  case  shows a  ' d o minant-recessive'  pattern,  with  one  range  generally  larger  and  more centrally  focused  than  the  other.  MacLaury  interprets  these  results  using  what he  terms  'vantage  theory',  the  method  by which  'a  person  makes  sense  of  some part  of  his  world  by picking  out  specific  points  of  reference  and  plotting  their relation  to  his  own  position,  a  process  that  is spatial  and  temporal  in  the  first order  but  incidentally  visual'  (1997:  138-9).  In  other  words,  MacLaury  claims t hat  (1)  the  processes  of  categorization  are  constructed  by  analogy  to  space or  time  dimensions,  and  (2)  colour  categorization  itself is ultimately  predicated upon  various  shifting  figure-ground  relations  (similar  to  those  famous  optical illusions  where  either  a face  or  table  might  appear  to  an  onlooker,  depending on  which  part  of  the  picture  is being  attended  to  at  any  given  time).  Colour categories  arise,  then,  by  alternating  shifts  of  emphasis:  at  first  colours  are grouped  together  with  an  elemental  hue  on  the  basis  of similarity  (e.g.  yellows are  being  included  in  the  category  RED, as many yellowish  colours  seem similar to  some  light  reds). After  that,  the  category YELLOW may  be  developed  on  the basis  of  how  distinctly different these  hues  may  appear  to  be  from  the  reds. While  others (e.g.  Stanlaw  and  Yoddumnern, 1985) have  argued t h a t taxonomies  and  other  methods  of classification  are  based  on  spatial  analogies, MacLaury's  detailed  linguistic  and  ethnographic  data  makes  the most compelling  case  to  date.

Vantage  theory  seems  to  have  the  potential  to  resolve  a  n u m b e r of perplexing  issues in  colour  nomenclature,  including  the  multiplicity  of  Russian BLUE  terms,  or  the  problems  of  the  GRUE  (green  and  blue) categories. MacLaury  reminds  us that  the  work  on  classification  and  colour  nomenclature belongs  to  neither  the  universalists  nor  the  relativists, but  is necessarily  a  blend of  t h e  two  approaches.  Current  research  on  colour  vocabulary  is  at  a t heoretical  crossroads,  giving  advocates  of  both  persuasions  an  opportunity

t o  finally  understand t h a t  no  culture is l i m i t e d only  to  biological or psychological  universals,  while  at  the  same  time  realizing  that  no  culture  can vary without  constraint.  We  can  now  see  how vantage  theory  might  approach t h e  analysis  of paapuru we  have  been  discussing  in  this  chapter.

## The  English  loanword  'purple'

In  1987  I  examined  the  denotation  and  connotation  of  English  colour  term word-pairs  in Japanese  in  some  detail  (Stanlaw,  1987).  As  we  have  seen  in Chapter  9,  it  appears  that  every  basic  native Japanese  colour  term  has  its English  counterpart.  To  things  in  terms  of vantage  theory,  most  of  these  wordpairs  name  categories  co-extensively  (as  described  above).  However,  I  also found  that  these  terms  differed  significantly  in  terms  of feeling  and  association. Loanword  colour  terms  seemed  to  be  lighter  and  more  focused  in  terms  of hue  (see  Figures  9.2  to  9.9),  and  also  carried  feelings  of  modernity.  Native Japanese  colour  terms  were  more  focused,  darker,  traditional,  and cultured t h a n  t h e  loanwords.  Men  often  thought  loanwords  to  be  associated  with  the notion  of  'clever'  while  women  often  viewed  them  as  'silly'  on Osgood's Semantic  Differential Scale  (see  note  8).  In  the  nomenclature  of  vantage theory,  choice  of  term  at  given  time,  then,  is  dependent  on  selecting  a  word from  a dominant-recessive  pair according  to context.  MacLaury  (1995)  analyses the  particular.

The  hierarchy  of  meaning  and  associations  shown  in  Figure  10.6  indicates options  and  perspectives  that  people  take  when  choosing  a  term. The parameters  of  traditional  versus  modern  and  clever  versus  silly are  treated  as any coordinate  in vantage  theory  (like brightness  or  similarity discussed  above). Making a choice,  then,  entails focusing  -  zooming  in  or  out  at  different  levels. Thus,  in  this  model,  it  is not just  features  of  physical  colour  that  are  attended to  at  any  given  time.  Instead,  there  is an  interaction  with  context,  connotation, and  denotation  at  any  moment.  People  can  move  up  and  down  the  levels  as needed  depending  on  the  situation.  As  MacLaury  says:

Nuances  of  meaning  become  increasingly  subjective,  subtle,  and  culturespecific  at  depths  of  the  hierarchies.  First  and  top-most  is the  perception  of strong  purple,  a  neural  reflex.  Second  down  are  the  universal  cognitive emphases of similarity and  distinctiveness, which  further  determine  category width.  Third  are  dark  and  light,  which  are  open  to  a  number  of  symbolic associations  .  .  . Fourth  are  the  culture-bound  values  of  traditional  and modern.  Fifth  is  the  socially  governed  gender  difference  in  emotional response. The  hierarchic  descent  marks  no  divide  between  denotation  and connotation,  but  places extremes of denotation  and  connotation  at  opposite ends  of  a cline.  (MacLaury,  1995: 268)

## Conclusion

The  arguments  made  here  for Japanese  may  probably  be  applied  to  most languages  and  most  cultures. All cultures  are  faced  with  devising  techniques for  describing  non-dominant  sensations. Various  devices  are  available,  and while Japanese  may utilize  their  extensive  and  readily available  set of  English loanwords, other  languages  obviously may use other  stratagems. 10

Finally,  it  should  be  mentioned  again  that  the  arguments  made  in  this chapter  are  not  Whorfian.  That  is, I am  not  claiming  here  that  the  use  of English loanwords affects  perception  (creating new foods, altering how people might  see  colours,  etc.). However,  I have  made  these  arguments  in  the  past, and  I still  remain  convinced  of much  of their validity.  I do  not  think  this is a contradiction,  as what  is going  on  is a very  complicated  interactive  process involving  several  (if  not  many)  domains,  code  systems,  and  sociolinguistic parameters. The Japanese  language  (like all languages)  contains  multitudes. Language  sometimes  influences  perception, while at other  times - as in  the instances  cited  here  -  it  is sensation  that  influences  language.  Metaphors based  on  English  enter Japanese  but  the  loanwords  used  to  symbolize  them are  slightly  different  from  those  that  native  English  speakers  might  expect. Examples  mentioned  previously  include  what  Americans  call  'spaghetti westerns';  the Japanese  name  these makaroni uestan ('macaroni  western'). Dokutaa sutoppu ('doctor  stop')  is the  prohibition  on  certain  activities, such  as smoking or  drinking,  that are  prescribed  by physicians  (e.g. Tabako o suu koto ni dokutaa sutoppu ga kakatta, 'My doctor  had  me  quit  smoking').

I  have  argued  in  this  chapter  that  manipulating  the  open-ended  nature of symbols is one  device used for  these creative ends; and  I claim  that a theory of classification  based on  motivated conventions accounts for  this. Considering the  extensive  education  Japanese  people  receive  in  formal  English,  the historical  interest  and  curiosity  the Japanese  have  always  had  with  things Western,  and  the  increasing  physical  and  economic  contact  among  all countries of the world, it is no longer valid to ask, 'Why do the Japanese  borrow so  much  English?'  A more  appropriate  question  might  be:  'Why is it we  do not  see  more Japanese  English  or  English  loanwords?'

## Images of  race  and  identity in Japanese and  American language and culture contact

## Introduction

The  founding  totemic  figure  in  American  anthropology,  Franz  Boas  (18581942),  taught  us  about  the  dangers  of  conflating  notions  of  race,  language, and  culture. 1 Being a wise if cantankerous  old sage, he instilled  in most  linguists and  anthropologists  a healthy  respect  for  this  problem  and gave  many  reasons to  keep  race,  language,  and  culture  separated,  both  in  theory  and  in  practice (Boas,  1940).  Although  anthropologists  may be  aware  of  these  warnings,  we also  know  too well  that  most  people  in  the world  care  little  for  such  cautions. Ethnic  and  racial  identity  is often,  if not  always,  expressed  in  language,  and such  expressions  become  compounded  in  language  contact  situations. 2

The Japanese-American  encounter  has gone  on now for well over a  century and  a  half.  Naturally,  both  Japanese  and  Western  views  of  self,  race,  a n d l a nguage  are  encoded  and  reified  in  the  discourse  generated  by this  contact. In  this  chapter  I will  briefly  trace  this  path  of language  contact  and  blending, and  discuss  how the respective  language  attitudes  have  changed.  I argue  that t he  beliefs  that  the Japanese  and  the Americans  have  had  about  the  mutual superiority  and  inferiority  of  their  languages  have  gone  through several metamorphoses,  and, in  a  sense,  have  become  reversed.  These  changes  in attitudes  that  we will  examine  are  outlined  in  Table 11.1.

The  names  of the English  and Japanese  syncretism  alone,  I think,  make  a fascinating  sociolinguistic  document;  the  monikers  given  at various  times  to the Japanese-English  mixture  of codes  reflect  changing  attitudes  and  positions:

'English  as she is Japped'  (Chamberlain, 1904) Janglish'  (Morris, 1970) Japlish'  (Pierce, 1971) Japanized  English'  (Sibata, 1975) Japanese  English'  (Morita, 1978) 'fapangurisshu (Kashima, 1981) Japalish'  (Pereia,  1983; Watanabe, 1983)

The  story, in brief,  goes  something  like  this: Americans  initially  believed the Japanese  language  to  be  too  barbarous  or  too  difficult  to  master;  and besides, even  if one  could  do so, for what purpose  could  it be used? Japanese, of  course,  felt  that  English  must  be  studied  if  the  country  was  ever  to modernize.  But  today more Americans  than  ever are studying Japanese,  and the  number  is increasing  at an  exponential  rate.

More  interesting,  however,  is the  new  self-confidence  the Japanese  are feeling  regarding  their  own  language.  Gone  are  the  days  when  Japanese statesmen  like Mori Arinori  in  1873 would  claim  that Japanese  is 'doomed  to yield  to  the  domination  of  English',  as we have  seen  in  Chapter  3.  Instead, Japanese  linguists,  Diet  members,  and  corporate  presidents  now  say  that Japanese  is a superior  language  that should  be  learned  by everyone. I would, in  fact,  claim  that  much  of  this linguistic  pride  is due  to  economic  progress and  success. That  in  itself  is a rather  pedestrian  remark.  What  is  significant, however,  is  the  nationalistic  reasoning  behind  such  linguistic  chauvinism. Ultimately,  this  is one  special  manifestation  of what  anthropologists  call  the Boas Problem,  the  confusion  resulting from  confounding  race, language  and culture. The  consequences  of this remain  to be  seen.

## The  language  attitudes  of  the  Meiji  (1868-12)  and  Taisho  (191226)  Periods: The Japanese  and  American  views

As we have seen in Chapter 3, in spite of what many Westerners believe, English in Japan  is hardly  a post-Second  World  War  phenomenon  that was  brought over by occupying  GIs along with  their  baseball,  hot  dogs, and  swing  music. Instead,  it was the  naval  expedition  of  the  American  Commodore,  Matthew Calbraith  Perry, which  brought  English  irrevocably  to  the  islands  in  1853.

'Old  Bruin',  as  Perry's  seamen  affectionately  called  him,  shocked  the Japanese by landing his 'black'  steamships near the Izu Peninsula, not far  from the  heart  of  the  government.  The  Tokugawa  shoguns,  in  an  effort to consolidate  their  newly-won  power,  had  effectively  closed  off  the  country around  1640, ostensibly  in  an  attempt  to  ban  Christianity  from  the  islands. Several centuries later, however, Americans decided  they needed  an  economic presence  in  the  Far  East,  and  to  this  end  dispatched  Perry's  squadron supposedly to seek protection  and  reprovisioning for American whaling ships. But  as  Perry  wrote  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Navy,  '[t]he  real  object  of  the expedition  should be concealed from  public view . . .'  (quoted  in Wiley, 1990: 72).

To the Japanese,  Perry's  'open  door'  policy was more  akin  to having  the foyer  kicked  in  by the  uninvited  drunk  than  entertaining  a welcomed  guest. For  the  Tokugawa  government  the  lessons  of  China  in  the  1840s was  clear: Westerners would carve up a weak Eastern  country if given half a chance,  and there  were  many  in Japan  who were  determined  not  to  give  the  Westerners that  opportunity.  The  arrival  of  the  Americans  precipitated  the  downfall  of two and  half  centuries  of  rule  by  the  Tokugawa  shoguns,  leading  to  the  reestablishment  of  the  emperor  system,  the  so-called  Meiji  Restoration,  of imperial  rule  and  power.

The vision  of  the  new  government  was to  meet  the Westerners  on  their own terms. Japan would become as modern  a power as any in the Pacific,  and they  would  industrialize  and  arm  themselves  with  the  latest  technologies available. The country was instantly modernized, and within a decade the social and  economic  fabric  of the  nation  was completely changed.  To achieve  these goals, Western  technologies  of every kind were  imported.  Naturally,  this  also brought  in Western  languages. The very legitimacy of the Japanese  language itself  was questioned  by influential Japanese  leaders  and  educators.  English was the language of modernity. English was the language of the future.  During the  years  of  the  Meiji  Restoration,  English  therefore  became  the  foreign language  of  choice  for  those  who  wanted  to  modernize Japan  and  build  a society  that  emulated  the  West.

While  the Japanese  were  beginning  their  infatuation  with  English,  the Americans  were  discovering  a  linguistic  minefield.  A  commentary  by Lieutenant  George  Preble, one  of Commodore  Perry's adjutants,  showed  the

prevailing  attitude  at  the  time,  which  was  Preble's  Law,  dictated  that  any communication  that was going  to  take  place  between  Americans  and  Japanese would  have  to  be  done  in  English  (Chapter  3).

To be  sure,  there  were  foreigners,  often  missionaries  or  doctors, who  could speak Japanese.  An  American  was  even  able  to  write  the  first  comprehensive Japanese-English  dictionary  in  the  1870s  (Hepburn, 1867;  1872;  1886). However, Japanese-speaking  foreigners  were  hardly  the  norm. 3

## The  language  attitudes  of  the  Shoowa  Period  (1926-89):  The Japanese  and  American  views

Language  contact  in  the  ensuing  years  continued  unabated. Colourful i n t e r l a n g u a g e s  like  the  Yokohama  Dialect  in  the  nineteenth  century  and Bamboo English  during  the American  Occupation  eventually met  their  demise. The  Second  World  War  was  only  a  short  hiatus  in Japanese-English l a n guage contact.  However,  until  relatively  recently,  the  old  Preble's  Law  seemed  to  be etched  in  stone.  Americans  were  reluctant  to  learn Japanese,  and  Japanese themselves  also  seemed  to  think  this  is  impossible  for  them  to  do  so. As  one critic,  the  influential  linguist  Suzuki  Takao,  stated  in  1978:

Nazegaikokujin  ni Nihongo o oshieru ka? . . .  Gaikokujin niwa Nihongo ga wakaru hazu ga nai. (Suzuki,  1978a:  176)

Why teach Japanese  to foreigners?  . . .  There  is no  reason  to expect  them  to understand Japanese.

This  is a  loaded  statement,  obviously.  Indeed,  we  have  not  heard  the  last  from Suzuki  Takao,  an  eminent  and  outspoken  commentator.

By the  1980s  the  symbiotic  relationship  between Japanese  and  English  had become  well-established.  By  then,  the  average  number  of  commonly  used l o a n words  in Japanese  range  was  probably  somewhere  from  3,000  to  5,000 terms,  or  perhaps  as  high  as  5  to  10 percent  of  the  daily vocabulary.  The  vast majority  of  these  borrowed  words  came  from  English.  However,  thisjapanized English  has  always  had  its  share  of  detractors.  For  example,  we  have  seen  in Chapter  2  that  the  blending  of Japanese  and  English  together  did  not  always make  hybrid  vigour.

As any  sociolinguist  knows,  issues  of  language  are  often  some  of  the  most volatile  that  a  society  faces.  The  use  of  English  in J a p a n  was  not  a  major political  problem  as  in,  for  instance,  Africa  or  India.  Still,  the  use  of  English in Japan  was  tied  to  notions  of  national  identity,  the  individual's  notion  of  self, and  problems  of Japan's  place  in  the  modern  world,  and  indeed  still  is.  Is  a person  who  uses  an  exorbitant  number  of  English  loanwords  being  modern and  cosmopolitan,  technical  and  scientific,  or  merely affected  and  pretentious?

Is  a  p e r s o n  who  uses  less  English  old-fashioned  and  backward,  or  perhaps affected  and  pretentious  in  a  different  way?  Can Japanese  be  spoken today without  the  use  of  loanwords?  Because  of  the  extent  of  borrowing,  Japanese people  face  such  issues  every  day  in  their  personal  conversations and i mpersonal  encounters  with  the  mass  media.

The  'problem'  of  English  in Japan  has  thus  a  number  of  aspects  which are  all  interrelated.  In  particular  there  are  the  perceived  problems  of  pollution and  the  perceived  problem  of  the  'copycat  mentality'  of  the  Japanese.

## The  problem of pollution

In  the Asahi Shimbun newspaper  on  27  May  1963,  the  following exchange between  a  reader  and  the  editors  occurred:

I  can  remember  coming  across  the  following  words  in  your  paper: low-teen, morale,  instant,  start, hospitality,  trouble, to  mention  but  a few. Could  these  not have  been  expressed  equally  comprehensively  in Japanese?

## The Asahi's reply:

Words we feel  to  be  strange  to  the  average  reader  and  words  which  in  our estimate  are still unfamiliar  to the  public are usually withheld;  the  newspaper should try to reach as wide a range of readers as possible by using a vocabulary easy to grasp. Of late the use of foreign  words has grown by leaps and  bounds.

.  .  .  For  all  intents  and  purposes  we appear  to  be  a foreign-loving  people. Anything  in katakana looks  sweet  and  fresh.  We bow  to  it,  and  value  it  too much.

This  exchange  is  interesting  for  several  reasons.  First,  the  reader  chides  the newspaper  for  choosing  English words when  native Japanese  equivalents  might have  sufficed.  The  newspaper  also  points  out  that  care  is  taken  to  use  only t h o s e  words  which  they  feel  are  in  the  general  vernacular  and readily understood.  Finally,  the  newspaper  believes  that  the Japanese  reading  public is  a p p a r e n t l y  enamoured  with  foreign  terms,  and  concedes  that  they  'value [them]  too  much'.

As  one  might  expect,  there  are  many  purists  who  bemoan  the  use  of English  in  J a p a n e s e t o d a y .  These  critics  range  from s c h o o l t e a c h e r s t o grandmothers,  from  politicians  to  respected  academics.  Although  there  is  no J a p a n e s e  equivalent  to  the  Academie  Francaise ( t h e  Kokuritsu Kokugo Kenkyuujo,  or  'National  Language  Research  Institute',  notwithstanding),  some official  government  agencies  often  denounce  English  loanwords  and  proscribe t heir  use.  Ironically,  however,  these  memorandums  often  contain  an  aboveaverage  number  of  borrowed  words.  As  the Asahi  Shimbun commented  in  an editorial  some  time  ago:

I  did  not  realize  English  words  had  been  added  to  the  'officialese'  used  in government  offices.  . . . In  these  reports kokoro [heart]  becomes  English ' mind', henka [change]  becomes  'shift', kooyaku [promise] becomes ' commitment', chooten becomes  'peak', soko becomes  'bottom',  and akichi [vacant lot] becomes 'open space'.  . . .  There is a certain  charm  to  affectation when  it goes  only  as far  as this, but  it becomes  tiresome  to  read  such  terms as  'crowding  out  effect',  'portfolio  shift',  'impact  loan',  'the  scale  merit  of family finances',  and  'reschedule  request'. After  a time one  cannot  continue reading  under  the  pretence  that  one  understands  all these words.  . . .  Why do  they  use  so  many  English  words?  Do  they want  people  to feel  that  their work  really  must  be  the  compositions  of  'bureaucrats'  at  the  'centre'  of  an 'economic  superpower'?  Do  they  feel  that  in  order  to  create  a  'high-level' ' academic'  and  'international'  mood,  they  must  have  the  help  of  English words  that  people  find  difficult  to understand . . . ? (28 August  1984)

Many Westerners,  too,  as  early  as  the  turn  of  the  century,  have  lamented t he  presence  of  so  much  English  in Japanese.  Basil  Chamberlain  (1904:  13746),  one  of  the  eminent  interpreters  of  Meiji Japan  to  the  West,  expressed curiosity  at  'English  as  she  is Japped'.  No  less  an  authority  than  the  late  Ivan Morris  cried  that:

Unless something is done  to curb  the pollution  of the vocabulary by English and  pseudo-English  words, the Japanese  language  will soon  become  as ugly and unpotable  as the Sumida and  those other great rivers whose fresh  waters have been  irretrievably  contaminated  by poisonous  foreign  matter.  (Morris, 1970: 454)

Apparently,  both Japanese  and  Westerners  of  this  persuasion  want  to  preserve some  kind  of  pristine Japanese  language  of  the  past,  uncontaminated by outside  influences. 4

Miller  (1977,  1982,  1988)  has  argued  that  the Japanese,  as  a  nation  and culture,  tend  to  define  themselves  in  terms  of  their  language:  those  who  are Japanese,  and  only those who  are Japanese,  can  speak Japanese. As several  have pointed  out  (e.g.  Unger,  1987),  Miller  certainly  overstates  his  case.  However, t h e r e  is  n o  d o u b t  that  many Japanese  feel  a  close  tie  between  their  language and  culture.  The  problem  is therefore  one  of  identity:  if speaking Japanese  is so important  to being Japanese  and  maintaining Japanese  culture, what  should be  done  about  the  mass importation  of English,  and  its being  readily  accepted? We will  come  back  to  this  issue  in  the  following  sections.

## The  alleged 'copycat'  mentality of  the Japanese

During  the  Shoowa  Period,  many  Westerners  and  a  surprising  number  of Japanese  parroted  a  mantra  that  is still with  us  today:  the  copycat  stereotype. A surprising  large  number  of  people  still believe  in  the  'copycat  myth',  which

basically goes something like this: The Japanese  are certainly great  improvers, and  perhaps  even  competent  engineers. However, they lack spontaneity;  their culture  stifles  individual  creativity  and  they  are  not  original  thinkers.  Thus, they can  make better  cars and  cameras after  they have been  invented,  but  do not  look  to  the Japanese  for  innovation  or  basic  research.

With all the technical advances made in Japan  in just the past few  decades alone,  it is hard  to  imagine  that  such  stereotypes  are  still being  perpetrated. However, many people mistake a curiosity and  fascination  with Western  items to  be  the  same  thing  as  admiration  and  infatuation.  Thus,  for  some,  using English  is just  one  more  example  of silly Japanese  imitation  of foreigners  and their habits. Obviously this stereotype is ridiculous, often  spouted  by American commentators  whose  national  pride  was hurt  or  by politicians  looking  for  a scapegoat  during  times  of  economic  difficulties.  The  copycat  mind  is  even harder  to apply  to language.  Hopefully,  the  examples  presented  throughout this  book  have  demonstrated  the  creative  ways that Japanese  apply  and  use English.

With  the decline  of the  Japanese  Miracle'  and  the  'Bubble  Economy', we have heard  less about  copycats but more  about how the Japanese  government might  take  steps  to jump-start  their  industrial  productivity.  Still, by the  1990s users of  Japanese  English were felt  to be either vile polluters - language  slobs who cared  little  for  either Japanese-language  national  pride  or  development - or  mere  copycats  who  were  simple  consumers  of  linguistic  fashion  and cultural  chic.

## The  language  attitudes  of  the  Heisei  Period  (1989  to  present): The  American  views

With  the  death  of Emperor  Hirohito  in  1989, a new imperial  era,  the  Heisei Period  of  Enlightened  Peace,  has  begun.  The  contemporary  American  view towards the Japanese  language  has changed  significantly  from  Meiji  times. If class  enrolments  are  any  indication,  Preble's  Law  has  now  been  repealed several  times over. The  number  of course offerings  in Japanese  in  the  United States  has  climbed  dramatically  and  the  number  of institutions  offering  the language  has  tripled  in  the  past  decade.  The Japanese  language  students  at my university  all wear  a pin  saying  'Be  Prepared,  Study Japanese'.  Although the  number  of  students  taking Japanese  still  pales  by  comparison  to,  for instance, Spanish, it is the fastest-growing  foreign  language  programme  in  the United  States. Not  only can  Americans  learn Japanese,  they are  doing  so  in great  numbers.

There  are  also several reasons why Americans now feel  they should  learn Japanese. While  many students who studied  the  language  in  the  1980s were attracted  by some  cultural  appeal  (poetry  or  music,  Zen  Buddhism,  martial

arts,  and  so  on),  many  newer  students  want  to  learn Japanese  for  more pragmatic  reasons.  It  is  no  doubt  useful  to  be  able  to  tell  a  prospective employer that you are a Japanese-speaking American who could  represent  his company. It is also possible that the new graduate may be working in the  future for  some Japanese  company,  either  abroad  or  in  the  United  States. To  use another  example from  my university hometown, one  of the largest  employers is a Japanese  automobile  manufacturing  plant.

## The  language  attitudes  of  the  Heisei  Period  (1989  to  present): The Japanese  views

Heisei Japan  is  quite  unlike  the  Meiji Japan  of  150  years  ago. Japan,  as everybody knows, did industrialize, fight  several Western  powers, and  did  fully recover  from  defeat  in  the  Pacific  War. Today,  it still  has  one  of  the  world's strongest economies, in spite of all the current gloating over  Japan's  recession in  American  business  magazines.  In  the  next  century,  the Japanese  gross national  product  (GNP)  will still approach,  if not  surpass,  that  of  the  United States', not  only in  relative, but  also in  absolute  terms.

Along with this economic strength  has come a new cultural and  linguistic self-confidence.  Throughout  much  of  the  twentieth  century,  most Japanese believed  that  learning  English  was a vital necessity for  personal  and  national success.  To  be  sure,  the  style  of  English  that  many  of  the Japanese  studied placed a strong emphasis on reading and grammar over speaking and  listening. Still,  this  knowledge  was considered  vital for  personal  career  growth  and  for Japan's  national  success as a developing  nation.

While  English  continues  to be  studied  heavily,  the Japanese  realize  that their  language  is as legitimate  as any other.  There  is no  longer  the  linguistic inferiority  complex  that plagued  the early Meiji intellectuals and  leaders. Four trends  seem  to  support  this. First,  as mentioned  above,  there  are  now  more people studying Japanese  than  ever before. Although  there has been  a  tenfold increase  in  the  number  of Americans  studying Japanese  in  the  past  decade, that  is  only  part  of  the  story.  The  numbers  of  Chinese,  Southeast  Asians, Indians,  Pakistanis,  and  people  from  the  Middle  East  who  are  studying Japanese  have also increased  remarkably. This rate  of increase  is even  larger than  in  the  United  States.  This  fact  has  undoubtedly  been  noticed  by  the Japanese.

Second, Japanese  have found  that  their  language  is not  as  'backward'  as they had  been  told. For example, it had  been  predicted  that  the  peculiarities and idiosyncrasies of the Japanese writing system would forever  hold the  nation back from  true  progress.  It was said  that  no  pictographic  mass media,  much less  a Japanese pictographic  mass  media,  could  ever  be  as  versatile  as  an alphabetic  medium.  However,  the Japanese  are  the world's  largest per  capita

print  consumers.  Not  only  are  there  more  newspapers  in  Tokyo  than  there are in Chicago or New York, there are even more English-language  newspapers. It was also claimed  that  it would  be impossible  for  the  masses  to ever  become fully  literate  under  such  a complex writing system. However,  the  literacy  rate in modern Japan is well-known. Finally, it was said that the computer age would finally  show the  poverty of  the Japanese  writing system. This language,  it was argued,  could  never  be  used  for  things  like  word  processing,  data  entry, machine billing, automated  mailing, or computer  programming.  However, all these  things  can  now  be  routinely  done  in  the Japanese  language  in  the Japanese writing system, albeit still somewhat slower than in Western  languages. As I mentioned,  the real reason why the Japanese  have been so avidly pursuing 'Fifth  Generation'  computer  technology and  artificial  intelligence  is not to  get a  world  monopoly  on  another  leading  technology  (Unger,  1987). They just would like to be able to use a computer and word processor as easily as anyone using a Western  alphabetic machine. Undoubtedly, more powerful  computing will soon  make  this a  reality.

Third,  it appears  that  the Japanese  have  become  more  accepting  of  the 'made-in-Japan'  loanwords  that  were  mentioned  earlier.  This  Japanized' version  of  English  is  being  used  with  increasing  frequency  because  real 'English'  English  is not  needed  by most people  for  most  things. These  terms that  are  inspired  by English  vocabulary  items  need  not be (or remain) British or American  after  they are  'borrowed'  from  abroad  or  'made'  at  home.  For example,  as we have seen  in  Chapter  2, meeru &gt;-)V ('mail')  means  'e-mail' in Japanese,  and  if you  use  the  'correct  English'  term ii meeru  -j-^-Jl , it is most likely that you would  not be understood. As I have argued  before, we should not expect these loanwords to conform  to any preconceived  contextual or  linguistic  notions  simply  because  we  happen  to  be  native  speakers  of English. As one informant  said to me, 'The important thing is that we Japanese understand  what is being said,  right?'

Fourth, while we see more  use of English  in general,  there  are also  those who are  reacting  strongly  against  this. For  example,  Loveday  (1996)  tells  of two  lawyers  in  Shimane  Prefecture  who  filed  a  petition  with  the  local government  to  have  them  stop  using Japanese  English  in  their official documents.  They  attacked  catch-phrases  like  the  local  administration's Rifuresshu Rizooto Shimane ('Refresh  Resort Shimane')  and Shimanesuku Shimane ('Shimane-esque  Shimane'),  which  were  intended  to  promote  tourism,  as corrupting  beautiful  and  elegant Japanese.  Koizumi Junichiroo,  the  current Prime  Minister,  also  came  down  hard  on  the  extensive  use  of  loanwords  in Japanese. While he was Health  and Welfare  Minister in  1989, he  established  a task  force  to  eliminate  such  terms  as taaminaru  kea ('terminal  care') or noomaraizeeshon ('normalizing' patients  back  into  society  after being institutionalized), as he felt  that ordinary citizens, especially the elderly,  could not  easily understand  such  neologisms  (Loveday,  1996).

The fifth t r e n d is  one t h a t is  probably t h e most i n t r i g u i n g t o anthropologists.  For  lack  of  a  better  name,  I will  call  it  the  linguistic  version of  Nihonjin-ron (Stanlaw,  1995a).  Roughly, Nihonjin-ron translates  as  'the  theory of  being Japanese',  and  is something  of a national  pastime  in Japan.  Television talk  shows,  popular  and  scholarly  magazines,  and  daily  newspapers often discuss  the  'problem  of  who  the Japanese  are',  or  'where  the Japanese  came from'.  In  these  discussions,  it is the  stress  on  the  uniqueness  of being Japanese that  is most  often  emphasized.  One  informant  told  me, perhaps  not  completely in  j e s t , t h a t t h e  J a p a n e s e  are  so  different t h a t  they  must  have  come from another  planet.

However,  such  attitudes, which  may at first  seem  slightly amusing,  contain some  rather  significant  consequences. As Miller  (1982), an  important Japanese historical  linguist,  has  warned:

Most foreigners  are  simply unprepared,  either  intellectually  or  by  previous experience,  for  their  first  encounter  with  the  rampant Japanese  racism  that results from  this essential  confusion  between  language  and  race.  (1982: 146)

That  is,  this  is just  the  'Boas  Problem'  in  a  different guise.

Interestingly,  however,  there  might  be  a  number  of  serious  and  wellrespected Japanese  scholars who would  not be so quick  to dismiss  the  Japanese as  aliens'  hypothesis,  Boas'  caveat  or  not.  For  example,  there  are  at  least  three well-known  linguists  -  Tsunoda  Tadanobu  (1978a,  1978b,  1985a,  1985b), Suzuki  Takao  (1973,  1978),  and  Kindaichi  Haruhiko  (1957,  1978,  1988)  who  subscribe  to  rather  radical  hypotheses  about  language  in  general  and  the Japanese  language  in  particular.  The  odd  thing  is that  they are  often  so  readily accepted  by  many Japanese  with  so  little  questioning.

Tsunoda  Tadanobu's  book The  Japanese  Brain raised  some  controversy  when English  versions  of  his  work  began  to  appear  in  translation  in  the 1980s. Through  a number  of experiments  of playing  different  sounds  in  headphones in  each  ear,  Tsunoda  argues  that  the  actual Japanese  physical  brain  has  become modified  over  time  due  to  the Japanese  language.  As  Tsunoda  says:

The  main  difference between  the Japanese  and  Western  patterns [of hemispherical  dominance  of language  processing  in  the  brain]  lies in  vowel laterality.  The Japanese  brain  processes vowels as a verbal  sound  in  the  left hemisphere,  but  the Western  brain  processes  them  as a nonverbal  sound  in the  right  hemisphere.  (Tsunoda,  1985a: 45)

Also, these  differences  are  not  due  to  environmental  factors.  Peruvian  Japanese i mmigrants,  who  were  born  in  South  America  and  do  not  even  speak t h e Japanese  language,  supposedly  show  similar  neurological  patterns.  In  other words,  Japanese'  brains  are  quite  unlike  those  of  Americans,  or  Britons,  or perhaps  everyone  else in  the  world. As one  might  expect,  so far  there  has  been little  support  for  this  claim  found  by  other  experimental  psychologists.

Suzuki  Takao  has  made  a  n u m b e r of  sociolinguistic claims  for t h e uniqueness  of  the Japanese  language.  For  example,  in  his  discussion  of  the differences  between  what  anthropologists  call  terms  of  referent,  terms  of address,  and  terms  for  self,  he  says:

No study of  this angle  [on  the  differences  between  terms  of  referent,  terms of address, and  terms for self]  has been  conducted  [on  this problem]  because this problem  does not arise within  the  framework  of Western  linguistics . . . because  such  phenomena  do  not  exist  in  Occidental  languages.  (Suzuki, 1978b:  128)

Of  course,  as  any  sociolinguist  knows,  this  is  patently  untrue.  Also,  as  Miller (1982)  points  out,  Suzuki  has  made  a  number  of  extreme  claims  including the  following:  (1) Japanese  writers  deliberately  try  to  write  prose  in  as  obtuse a  manner  as  possible,  and  such  writing  is  especially  prized;  (2)  the  Japanese writing  system  is unlike  any  other  in  the  world,  and  is a  superior  orthography; and  (3)  teaching Japanese  to  foreigners  will  help  lead  to  world  peace.

Kindaichi  Haruhiko  has  been  one  of  the  foremost  proponents  of  the uniqueness  of  the Japanese  language.  One  of  the  things,  Kindaichi  argues, that  separates Japanese  from  other  languages  is its  great difficulty:

The Japanese  language, however, seems to be difficult  not only for  foreigners but  also  for  the Japanese  themselves .  .  .  Japanese  is  often  said  to  be complicated  and  difficult .  .  .  We could  also  say that Japanese  is a  topsy› turvy language and  that Japan  is a country which always takes the wrong  road . . .  The  great complexity of the Japanese  language is said to be weakest point. (Kindaichi,  1978: 23)

These  alleged  difficulties  are  many.  They  vary  from t h e  J a p a n e s e islands supposedly  having  so  many  different  dialects,  to  problems  with  the  writing system,  to  having  a  grammar  with  a  strict  'reverse  Polish  notation'  system  of word  order.  Of  course,  it  is  hard  to  say what  constitutes  the  most ' difficult' language;  anthropologists  would  be  satisfied  in  granting  this  dubious  honour to  n o  single  language.

Tsunoda  says  neurologically  the Japanese  are  unlike  anyone  else  in  the world.  Suzuki  says  that Japanese  sociolinguistics  is  unique.  Kindaichi  argues that  the Japanese  language  bears  no  relation  to any other.  The  message  behind all  these  claims  is  quite  clear:  There  are  certain  things  that  are  special  about t h e  J a p a n e s e  l a n g u a g e ,  and  particular  only  to  it.  Evidence  indicates t h a t Westerners  and  Japanese  learn,  receive,  and  process  language differently. Ultimately,  it  is  only Japanese  who  can  speak  real Japanese. Japanese  culture, of  course,  is  encoded  and  carried  within  the Japanese  language.  However,  it appears  that  only  someone  who  is  biologically  prepared  -  that  is,  racially Japanese  -  can  ever  really  master  the  language.  Thus,  only  people  born  into the  culture via  race can ever  understand  the Japanese.  But  this  is precisely  the

warning  that  Boas  made  half  a  century  ago:  race  (Tsunoda),  language (Kindaichi),  and  culture  (Suzuki)  are  separate  entities,  not  to  be  confused without  dire  consequences. 5

## Conclusion:  The Japanese  language,  race,  and  nationalism

One  does  not  usually  associate Japanese  nationalism  with  the  Japanese language  these days. The Japanese  nation-state is taken  for  granted.  However, if we look  at  nationalism  in  the  way sociologists  often  define  it -  that  is, as an  ideology  that  contributes  to  the  creation  of  a  special  kind  of  group consciousness  that  legitimates  and  fosters  the  creation  of  an  independent political  and  geographic  unit - the  role  of  the Japanese  language  becomes less  obscure.

As  mentioned,  during  the  Meiji  Restoration  radical  changes  in  the Japanese  language  were  seriously  suggested.  These  included  script  reform (everything from  simplifying  the  Sino-Japanese  characters  to replacing  them with  roman  letters),  changes  in  literary  styles  to  reflect  a  more  vernacular discourse, and  even  the abolition  of the Japanese  language itself. Indeed,  after the  Second World War, some of these changes  (at least in  orthography)  were adopted.  Despite  these  reforms,  until  relatively  recently,  the Japanese  have been  insecure  about  their  language.

The  pidgins  that  developed  in  Meiji Japan  and  after  the  Second  World War reflected  some of these attitudes. At first, Americans thought that Japanese could  not  be  learned  by Westerners,  and  besides,  the Japanese  should  learn English. The Japanese were only too quick to agree. However, Americans  also believed  that  English  could  never  really be  mastered  by Japanese,  as seen  in the  Bamboo  English  after  the  Second  World  War.  Even  today,  among  ESL teachers, the inability of  Japanese  students  to be able to actually speak  English - in  spite  of  half  a  dozen  years  of  study - is taken  as fact,  and  commonly joked  about.

The  extensive Japanese  borrowings  from  English  are  puzzling  both  to Westerners and Japanese alike. Westerners criticize the inability of the Japanese to  learn  'correct'  English  - with  loanwords  being just  one  more  example  and mock the many bastardized  Japanized'  English phrases heard  daily in  the country. In  many ways, they see this as just  one  more  example  of the  'copycat mentality'  of  the Japanese. Japanese  purists  and  government  officials  also lament  this pollution  of their  language; yet in  the very reports  in which  they present  their  criticisms, Japanized  English  phrases  may  be  more  frequent, though  perhaps  slightly  more  academic,  than  any  fashionable Harajuku teenager  talking about  rock  and  roll music. However,  neither  these Japanese nor American  critics seem  to realize  that  this use of English  is just  one  more very creative  tool  in  the  linguistic  repertoire  of  the Japanese  language,  used

by Japanese  people  for  their  own  communicative  purposes  (Stanlaw,  1988; 1992d).

Japanese  political,  social,  and  linguistic  self-confidence  is rapidly  growing. Japanese  as an  international  language  is now  taken  seriously,  an  idea  thought heretical  on  both  sides  of  the  ocean  even  a  few  years  ago.  There  is  even t he i n t e r n a t i o n a l equivalent  of  the  Japanese ' T O E F L ' .  In  1989  Morita  Akio (founder  of  the  Sony  conglomerate)  and  Ishihara  Shintaroo  (a journalist  and long-time  member  of  the Japanese  Diet)  wrote  a  controversial  book, 'Noo'  to Ieru  Nihon:  Shin  Nichi-Bei  Kankei  no Kaado (A Japan  That  Can  Say  'No': A  New Japanese-America  Relationship  Card).  This  book  (Morita  and  Ishihara,  1989; n.d.)  argues  that  the  relations  between Japan  and  America  were  politically  one› sided,  economically  unbalanced,  and  need  to  be  seriously  re-evaluated.  Aside from  making  the  usual  claims  of  the  superiority  of  the Japanese  economic system,  the  book  also  argues  that  racial  prejudice  is  the  greatest  source  of friction  between  the  two  countries:

As the  modern  civilization  created  by Caucasians  come  to an  end  in  the  last decade  of  the  twentieth  century,  we are  on  the  verge  of  a  new  genesis .  . . That Japan,  an  Oriental  country,  is about  to  supplant  them  in  some  major fields  is what  annoys  the Americans  so much.  (Ishihara,  1991: 30)

They  also  claim  that  the Japanese  language  is now  a vehicle  to  disseminate Japanese  culture,  and  to  demonstrate  the  creativity  of Japanese  individual:

Japan  is country  where  each  person  is highly  creative . .  .  There  has  been an  increasing  number  of Americans  and  Europeans who recognize Japanese [cultural]  creativity.  For  example,  the  French  previously  did  not  recognize Japanese  literature  at  all,  thinking  it  had  no  value.  Recently,  however,  the French  have  grown  to  appreciate Japanese  literature .  .  . and  it  is due  to Japanese  high  technology.  Foreigners  who  were  interested  in  Japanese technology  started  studying  the Japanese  language,  and  started  reading Japanese  novels. The foreign  literature  teachers and  translators did  not  point out  these  interesting  aspects  of Japanese  literature  -  it  was  done  by  the scientists.  (Morita  and  Ishihara,  1989:  79-80)

Ishihara,  with  a  number  of  colleagues,  completed  two  more  volumes  in this  series: Soredemo  'Noo' to Ieru  Nihon:  Nichibei-kan  no Kompon  Mondai (AJapan That  Can  Say  'No'  None  the  Less: The  Fundamental  Problem  Between  Japan and  America)  (Ishihara,  Watanabe,  and  Ogawa,  1990)  and Danko 'Noo'  to  Ieru Nihon: Nichibei-kankei no  Sookatsu (A Japan  That  Can  Say  'No'  Firmly:  A Recapitulation  of  the  Postwar Japanese-American  Relationship) (Ishihara  and Etoo,  1991). All  three  books  have  become  bestsellers. 6

Obviously,  much  of  the  controversy  surrounding  these  books,  both  in Japan  and  the  United  States,  ultimately  centres  around  economic  issues.  New words  being  used  in  current  Japanese  newspapers,  for  example, ken-bei or

' l o a t h i n g  America' (from ken'o ' t o  hate'  and bei-kou, ' A merica'),  shock an American  public  commemorating  the  50th  anniversary  of Pearl  Harbor  or  the end  of  the  Second  World  War.  An  underground  unauthorized t r a n s l a t i o n , supposedly  solicited  by  the  Pentagon,  of  much  of  the  first  edition of  A  Japan That  Say  No (Morita  and  Ishihara,  n.d.)  has  angered  US  Congressmen and j ournalists  alike.  So  controversial  was  this  translation  that,  before  he  died  in 1999,  Morita  Akio  would  not  allow  the  chapters  he  contributed  to  be  used  in t he  authorized  English  version  which  has  recently  appeared  (Ishihara,  1991).

It  s h o u l d ,  however,  be  noted  that  the Japanese  reaction  has  not  been unanimously  positive. For  example,  Honda  (1990)  wrote  a scathing  refutation of  Morita  and  Ishihara.  What  often  bothered  him  most  was  not  economics, but  racism  (1990:  24):

Unless  and  until  he  is ready  to  admit  and  say  'YES, our  racial  prejudice  is bad  enough',  Ishihara  or any other Japanese  has no  right  to point  his  finger at what  may be  happening  in some  other  country  on  this score.

atrocities prevent of

The  continuous  denials  of  the  'Rape  of  Nanking'  and  other committed  during  the  Second  World  War,  Honda  says, will  forever J a p a n  from  completely  joining  the  community  of  nations,  regardless l a n guage  or  sense  of  aesthetics.

However,  the  soundness  of  Ishihara  and  others'  economic,  political  or cultural  arguments  is not  the  most  salient  feature  of  the  situation.  In  spite  of the  correctness  of  their  position,  it is probably  no  coincidence  that when  these Japanese  revisionists  decided  to  present  their  arguments,  they  chose  to  do  so with  a  linguistic  metaphor.  The Japanese  are  now  completely self-sufficient, and  they  are  not  afraid  to  talk  back  to  their  long-time  protector  and  mentor. The  new Japan  is  a  country  that  can  vocalize  its  new  self-assurance:  It  is  the Japan  that  can say ' n o '  to America  (even  though  ironically  this negative  lexeme is  t h e  English  loanword noo a n d  not  the  native Japanese  term He).

## Japan, English, and  World Englishes

## Introduction

We have  seen  in  Chapter  11  that  the Japanese  are  very  cognizant  of  their position  in  the world, and  the part that language plays in it. In this  concluding chapter,  I will  connect  the  use  of  English  in Japan  to  the  wider  scope  of international  'Englishes'. I will argue, as others have done  (see Kachru,  1992; Smith  and  Forman,  1997; Tickoo,  1991; 1995; Bautista,  1997, for  example), that  English  is an Asian language,  and  indeed  a Japanese language  as well. I will examine the critics of the 'hegemony of English' in Japan and other places, but  argue  that Japanese  is hardly  oppressed.  Instead,  I suggest  it  is a  prime example  of the  colonized  co-opting  the  colonizer. Finally, I will sum  up  some of  the  main  points  I hope  I have  made  in  this  book.

## English  as a world  language

Although  scholars were previously well aware of this phenomenon,  it is likely that many others were clueless before Newsweek brought  things  unambiguously into focus:  'English, English, Everywhere'  proclaimed  a November  cover story in  1982, bumping off coverage of the Congressional elections giving a mandate to Reaganomics, as well the Pope's first visit to Spain to preach  against divorce, birth  control,  and  abortion.  Over  '700 million  people  now speak  English  . . . and [it  is  the]  key  to  getting  ahead  in  almost  every  country'  said the introductory  sidebar. 1 'English  is the  tongue  that Japanese  businessmen  use to  negotiate  a deal with  the  Kuwaitis.' Whether  some  other  language  is used to  talk with  Saudis  or  Egyptians  is not  stated,  but  'Like  it or  curse  it,  English has become  a new lingua franca  and  worldwide  business.'

In  the  twenty years since, these claims have become reinforced.  There  are numerous  measures  commonly  used  that indicate just  how pervasive  English is,  but  I will  mention  only  a few  of  them  here.  These  include  the  following half-dozen  facts:

- Precise  estimates,  of  course,  are  hard  to  make,  but  apart  from t h e  300 million  so-called  'native'  speakers  of  English,  there  are  at  least  700  million who  use  it  as  a  second  language,  and  up  to  a  billion  who  acquire  English as  a  foreign l a n g u a g e (cf.  McArthur,  1992,  1998;  Crystal,  1995,  1997), 2 perhaps  as  much  as  30  percent  of  the  world's  population.
- English  is the  main  language  of  the  international  media,  from  journalism to film  to music. More  books, movies, tapes, CDs, newspapers, video  games, and  television  programmes  are  produced  in  English  than  in  any  other l a n g u a g e .  Over  150 million radio  programmes  in  English  are  received  in 120  countries  (Alatis  and  Straehle,  1997:  3; emphasis  added).
- English  is the  official  language  of air  traffic  control  and  merchant  shipping at  sea;  it  is  also  the  de  facto  language  at  many  international  ceremonies and  sporting  events  (the  Olympics  being just  one  example).
- It  is  t h o u g h t  t h a t  s o m e  90  p e r c e n t  of  all  e-mail  messages  are  in  English (Swardson,  1996; Alatis  and  Straehle,  1997).
- About  three  quarters  of  the  world's  post  ('snail  mail')  is written  in  English (Alatis  and  Straehle,  1997).
- A quick  perusal  of  conference  listings  in  any  scholarly journal,  regardless of language,  shows  that  English  is by far  the  most  commonly  used  language at  international  scientific  and  academic  conferences.  It  also  appears  that business  meetings  and  conferences  also  rely  heavily,  if not  exclusively,  on English. Although  it is probably  hard  to get accurate  figures,  a vast  majority of  the  world's  scientists  probably  at  least  read  English; Alatis  and  Straehle (1997)  estimate  two-thirds  of  the  world's  scientists  read  English.
- Many  'foreign'  journals  accept  and  print  scholarly  articles  written in English.  Even journals  that  are  not  published  in  English,  as  often  as  not, have  English  abstracts  or  precis  included.

Finally,  the  most  important  point  is  that  The  British  Council  as  early  as 1986  recognized  that  the  majority  of  English  speakers  were  not  'native'. 3 That is,  of  t h e  700  million  people  cited  in  the Newsweek article  above  who  in  the 1980s  used  English  as  a  first  or  second  language,  some  385  million  are  not citizens  of  the  United  States,  the  United  Kingdom,  Canada,  Australia  or  New Zealand,  or  any  of  the  other  places  we  usually  think  of  as  being  Englishspeaking  countries.  The Newsweek article  also  suggested  that  as  many  as  two out  of five  people  in  the world  have  at least some  facility  in  the  language.  These numbers  have  gone  up:  Braj  Kachru  (1997a)  estimates  that  there  are  now  four non-native  speakers  for  every  traditionally-defined  native  speaker  of  English in  the  world.

There  have  been  at  least  two  results  of  this  English  explosion.  First,  the ' worldwide  business'  of  English,  as Newsweek p u t  it,  is  n o w  a  major industry, probably  rivalled  only  by  the  largest  high-tech  industries  in  terms  of  influence and  impact.  For  countries  such  as  Britain,  English  has  become  a  major  cash-

crop  and  export  commodity:  'Britain's  real  black  gold  is not  the  North  Sea oil, but  the  English  language  . . .  a national  resource'  (Romaine,  1992: 254). Such sentiments  also find  a resonance  in such  other  'inner  circle'  societies as the  USA, Australia,  and  New  Zealand,  which  also  have  their  own  Englishleading  industries.

The  second  result  has  been  an  increased  interest  by  professional academics  in  the  international  spread  and  usage  of English.  In  the  past  two decades  the  study  of  English  as  an  international  language  has  blossomed, and  there  have  been  a  plethora  of  books  on  the  topic,  in  spite  of  the  fact that  what  the  international  English  should  be  named  is still  very  much  in debate  (Mufwene,  1994).  General  edited  article  collections  include  Bailey and  Gorlach (1983),  Cheshire (1991),  Garcia  and  Otheguy (1989), Greenbaum  (1985),  Kachru  (1992),  Pride  (1982),  Quirk  and  Widdowson (1985), Smith  (1983a,  1983b,  1987), Smith  and  Forman  (1997), and  Viereck and  Bald  (1986). Article  collections  and  discussions  on  English  in  specific places - e.g. Asia  (Honna,  1990),  Singapore  (Bautista,  1997; Foley,  1988), Africa  (Bamgbose  et al.,  1997), Hong  Kong  (Bolton,  2000), China  (Bolton, 2003),  Malaysia  (Ooi,  2001),  or  India  -  are  also  numerous.  Classic  and recent theoretical works are Crystal  (1997), Kachru  (1986), McArthur  (1998), Piatt,  et  al.  (1984),  and  Todd  (1984).  World  Englishes  have  also  been examined  from  an  anthropological  perspective  (Bhatt,  2001).  Recent encyclopedias  on  English  (e.g. McArthur  [1992]  and  Crystal  [1995], or  the massive  multi-volume Cambridge History of the English Language) have  much material  on  'English  as  an  inter-national  and  intra-national  language'. 4 A major journal (World Englishes) and  numerous  conferences,  associations  and proceedings  now  complete  'English  as  an  International  Language'  as  a recognized  multidisciplinary  field.

However, we must remember  that  this new spread  of English  in  the  past few decades - whether, as a business, for business, or because  o/business  is different  from  in  earlier  times. Most significantly,  'English'  in  all  its  forms and  functions  is now increasingly  influenced  by non-native  users,  especially those  from  Africa  and  Asia.

## English  as an  Asian  Language

Braj  Kachru  (1996;  1997a)  astutely  remarked  that  English  is often  discussed as a language in Asia but not of Asia. He says that doing so is a critical mistake. For  even  nations  that  usually  see  themselves  as homogeneous  find  that,  for better  or worse, they must come to terms with culturally and  linguistically with English, whether  it be  a lover's embrace  or  rejection,  or  seeing an  old  friend again  for  the  first  time. But at  the  heart  of  the  matter  lies  the  question,  Just whose language  is it, anyway?'

With  reference  to  the  discussion  of  the  functions  of  English  as  an international  language,  Kachru  (1996a,  1997a;  1997b)  and  others  (e.g. McArthur,  1998)  also suggest we take  note  of the  following  points:

- In  Asia,  English  is  not  only  found  as a  first  language  in  Australia,  New Zealand  and  several  locales  in  the  Pacific  Islands,  it  is  present  as  an institutionalized  additional  language  in  many  linguistically  plural  and multicultural  societies. This  includes  official  language  status  in  not  only Australia  and  New  Zealand,  but  also  India,  Pakistan,  the  Philippines, Singapore,  Hong  Kong,  Brunei,  Palau,  Fiji,  the  Marshall  Islands, Micronesia, and Vanuatu. It has semi-official  status in Malaysia, Sri  Lanka, and  Bangladesh.  It is used  as a common  auxiliary  language  throughout the  Pacific,  and  is widely spoken  in  the American  dependencies  of  Guam and  American  Samoa. A creole-based  version  of  English  (Tok  Pisin)  is official along  with  standard  English  in  Papua  New  Guinea.  It  is  a compulsory,  or  de  facto,  second  language  in  Malaysia, Japan,  and  Korea, and  is a highly popular  foreign  language  in  China  and  Taiwan. 5 In  much of Asia, from  the  Himalayas to Polynesia, it is the  lingua franca  of  choice.
- English  is one  of  the  sixteen  official  languages  of  India  (Kachru,  1983). India  probably  has well over sixty million  speakers  of English,  making  it the third largest English-speaking nation  (following only the United  States with  250 million  and  the  United  Kingdom  with  50 million).
- Although  not  an  official  language,  China  has  over  200 million  students of English as a second language  (Yong and Campbell,  1995). This  number of students  is over  two-thirds  of  the  population  of  the  United  States.
- Almost every metropolitan  city in Asia has English-language  newspapers, and  radio  stations  broadcasting  in  English.
- There is increasing use of English in  the arts and  literature  in Asia. These include various  kinds  of  'bilingual  creativity',  such  as the  innovations  of Japanese English loanword usage described here, but also serious writings, such as drama, poetry, and  novels  (e.g. B. Kachru,  1997b; Y. Kachru,  1997; Abad,  1999; Abad  et al.,  1997).
- English  is of  course  used  for  mter-national  communication  among  the Asian  nations,  but  it  is  also  increasingly  being  used  for  m^ra-national communication.  India, for  example,  uses English  for  a variety of  social, governmental  and  cultural  purposes  (Kachru,  1983).
- Finally, we must realize that now 'the initiative in planning,  administration, and funding  for the increasing bilingualism in English in Asia is essentially in  the  hands  of Asians'  (Kachru,  1997a:  68). For  example,  not  only  do Asian English  speakers write a majority  of the pedagogical  materials  and teach  most of the  classes, they are also involved  in moving the  profession in  the  directions  of  their  choosing.

The  case  of Japan  is a  good  example  of  Point  6  above,  where  locals  have procured  the  'rights'  of  access  to  English.  Tanaka  and  Tanaka  (1995)  describe some  dozen  categories  of  English-language  textbooks,  dictionaries,  and  study aids  found  in Japan  in  the  1980s.  In  all,  they  found  more  than  1,600 titles, t h e  vast  majority  written in  J a p a n e s e  by Japanese.  There  are  dozens  of i mportant  professional  language-teaching  associations,  such  as  the  Japan Association  of  College  English  Teachers  (JACET), Japan  Association  for  the Study  of  Teaching  English  to  Children  (JASTEC),  and Japan  Association  of Language  Teachers  (JALT),  all  with  active  memberships. 6 There  are  also  a plethora  of  magazines  for  those  devoted  to  English  as either  a part-time  hobby or  as  an  academic  career.  These  include  the  popular The English  Journal, Eigo Kyooiku ('The  English  Teacher's  Magazine '),JijiEigo Kenkyuu ('Current  English Studies')  and  the Kenkyusha Yearbook of English. There  is also  a  new  scholarly j o u r n a l  on  the  use  of  English  as  an  international  language  the  Journal of Asian  Englishes -  published  and  edited  by Japanese  in  Japan.

In  many  writings  Braj  Kachru  also  talks  about  the  'concentric  circles'  of English  usage,  in  both  Asia  (e.g.  1997b) and  the  world (1986).  A  major argument  here  is  that  besides  an  'inner  circle'  of  'first-language'  users  of English,  there  is an  'outer  circle'  and  'expanding  circle'  of people  whose  native l a n g uage  is  n o t  English,  but  nonetheless  use  -  or  need  to  use  -  English  to varying  degrees  in  their  daily  and  professional  lives. This  outer  circle  includes nations  such  as India  and  Singapore,  where  English  is an  official  language  and is  used  for  many  governmental  and  social  purposes.  The  expanding  circle includes  nations  such  as China,  the  South  Pacific  islands, and  most  other  Asian nations,  where  English  has  become  increasingly  critical  in  local  and  global communication.  In which  circle a country  lies, of course, is somewhat  arbitrary, but  the  idea  of  the  spread  of  English  is  not.

Table  12.1  gives  some  statistics  on  countries  in  these  various  circles  in  the Asia-Pacific  region.  Populations  are  given  in  the  first  column,  and  an  estimate on  the  number  of speakers  of English  as either  a first  (LI)  or  second  language (L2)  is given  in  column  2. The  third  column  gives  the  'users'  of  English (that is,  s o m e o n e  who  is  either  a  speaker  of  English  as  a  first  or  second l a n guage) as  a  percentage  of  the  total  population.  The  inner  circle  of  'native'  speakers includes  the  Australians  and  New  Zealanders.  In  New  Zealand,  for  instance, the  total  population  is about  three  and  a half  million;  of  that,  about  3,1000,000 (or  93  percent)  speak  English  either  natively  or  as a  second  language.

What  constitutes  'knowing'  a  second  language  is  almost  impossible  to define (cf.  Lowenberg  [1993] just  for  a  start),  and  I will  admittedly finesse the  issue  here. Where  the  literature  cites a specific  estimate  of English  speakers in  a  nation,  I  use  that  figure.  Otherwise,  I  have  followed  Crystal's  suggestion of  using  the  n u m b e r  of  people  in  a  country  who  have  completed  secondary education  or  higher  as an  estimate.  Presumably  such  people  have  studied  some English,  and  are  'likely  to  have  English  as a  reasonable  standard'  (1995:  109).

This  may inflate  the  true  number  of English  speakers  in  places like Japan  or South Korea, and I will discuss this with reference  to Japan  later in this chapter.

Figure  12.1 shows these three circles in graphic form. While there are only 20 million native English speakers in the inner circle, once include the  English speakers  in  the  outer  circle,  the  total  rises  to  100 million.  If we  then  add  in the  260  million  speakers  of  English  from  the  expanding  circle,  we  find  a remarkable fact:  the  number  of English  speaker in Asia surpasses  the  total  for the United  States. The grand  total for  the number  of English  users in all  three circles is some  360 million  (or more  than  13 percent  of the population  in  the region).  Other  estimates  put  the  overall  total  as  double  that,  around  600 million  in  all.

A conservative  estimate

English  is an  official  language,  de  jure

- Based  on  a  model  and  terminology  proposed  in  Kachru  (1997a,  1997b),  and  in  part,  on  statistics given  in  Crystal  (1995:  109),  as well  as Central  Intelligence  Agency  (1999)  and  Brunner  (1999).
- Definitions  of  L2  speakers  are  notoriously  difficult,  so  these  estimates  need  to  be  taken  in  that  light. Crystal  (1995:  108)  suggests using  the  percentage  of people who  have  completed  secondary  education or  higher  -  presumably  then  having  studied  English  -  who  are  then  'likely  to  have  English  as  a reasonable  standard'.  This  criterion  was used  in  the  table  except  when  actual  figures  on  bilingualism are  available  for  a  specific  country.
- A plus  sign  (+)  indicates  that  the  number  of  either  Ll  or  L2  speakers  could  not  be  estimated  for  a given  country;  thus,  the  figure  cited  was  a  minimum  number  (i.e.,  the  known  value  of  either  Ll or L2  speakers).  Presumably,  there  would  be  more  Ll  and  L2  speakers  if all  the  data  were  available.

## English  as a Japanese  language

As  I  have  implied  earlier,  strictly  following  Crystal's  criteria  of  secondary education  as evidence  of  English  knowledge  might  be  very problematic.  By this  measure,  some  95  percent  of Japanese  would  be  considered  as  English users, as most Japanese  people, 95 percent  in  1990, enter  senior  high  school (Asahi Shimbun Japan Almanac, 1999). I would therefore  suggest that  college and  university  attendance  is a better  benchmark,  which  gives us a figure  of the  population  in  1990. However,  when  I asked  a Japanese  colleague  about how they felt  about  such  numbers,  the  response  was 'It sounds  high,  doesn't it? But if you ask any  Japanese  [in Japan]  a straightforward  question  in  English like  "Am I in  Tokyo?" they probably  could  understand  you.'

Regardless  of  the  actual  numbers  of  'truly'  bilingual Japanese  English speakers, however, we must  accept  the  fact,  for  better  or worse, that  English is a  Japanese  language. At first glance  this might appear strange, even to  those working  in  the  'International  English'  profession.  For  example,  in  the  twohundred-odd  articles  found  in  those  classic  edited  collections  on  'new'  or 'world' Englishes mentioned in the previous section, only a few address English in Japan. 7 But as I have attempted  to show in  this book, English  and Japanese are  now as inseparable  as the American  and Japanese  economies.  Indeed,  I would  argue  that Japan  today could  not  exist without  English,  and  that,  as in India  (Dutta,  1967). English is essential for the functioning  of  Japanese  society.

As I have discussed  throughout  the book,  the  relationship  of  Japanese  to English is not one easily described. It is not an official  language in the islands, nor  is it a remnant  of colonialism,  the American  occupation  notwithstanding. English was never imposed by a cadre of zealous missionaries urging  religious and  linguistic  conversion.  It  would  likewise  be  silly  and  wrong  to  say  that English  is anything  even  close  to  a national  second  language  in Japan,  as in South Asia or parts of Africa.  It also does not function  as a lingua franca  within the  polity  itself,  although  as Newsweek aptly  points  out,  English  is  used  by Japanese  overseas, or for  communication  with  those from  outside Japan.  It is institutionalized  in  the  sense  that  it is the  de  facto  foreign  language  learned in  school,  and  all  students  are  required  to  have  a fair  degree  of  knowledge about  English,  if for  nothing  else, to  enter  a university  (as English  is one  of the  major  subjects  in  entrance  examinations).

In  fact,  it  might  be  worthwhile  to  comment  on Japanese  'examination English'  at  this point.  To  the  dismay of countless  native professional  English teachers  and  foreigners,  the  English  in Japanese  entrance  examinations  is always picayune,  often  Victorian,  and  usually  dull.  In  the  summer  of  2001,  I had  the  occasion  to see a practice  test that a high  school student was using  to study for  his upcoming  test. As I was both  baffled  by the  directions  and  the point  of  the  questions,  my friend  dutifully  helped  me  take  this  test, which  I barely  passed,  to  the  amusement  of both  his parents  and  sister.  Critics  have

long lambasted  these  examinations  as being  completely written  and  archaic, with little measure  of the competence  of how well Japanese  individuals  might actually  communicate  with  someone  in  English. The  reluctance  to change,  I believe, might be precisely because these tests have little connection  to spoken native English. Again, if we keep remembering that  Japanese English is English for Japanese  purposes - and  not American  or British purposes - we see  that features  that  are  important  to Japanese,  i.e.  a  concern  with  grammatical correctness  over  communicative  competence,  reading  ability over  speaking skill, and  a touch  of British  Received  Pronunciation  (RP)  are emphasized  the most.

In  any case, as evidenced by the amount of English-language  teaching  and learning  materials found  in  even  the  smallest rural  bookstore,  or  the  English lessons found  on  the airways of radio and television almost any day of the week, it  is  at  least  the  hobby  of  millions.  In  1988, 2,361,000 Japanese  people  took the Test in  Practical  English  Proficiency  (Kodansha  Encyclopedia,  1993),  and 1,310,000  took  the  first  of  a  twice-a-year  STEP  (Society  for  Testing  English Proficiency)  examination  authorized  by the  Ministry  of  Education  in  1994 (Honna,  1995). 8

English  is, however,  more  pervasive  than just  as an  academic  subject.  An example of this might be seen in the number  of English-language  newspapers found  in Japan.  Table  12.2  (Part A)  shows some statistics on  the five  national English-language  newspapers  in Japan  (not  counting  the  local  or  regional papers, special-interest  newspapers, or newspapers intended  for  expatriates). The  total  circulation  of each  newspaper  is given  in  the  second  column  from the  right,  and  in  the  far-right  column  is the  number  of  copies  distributed each  issue  per  1,000  households.  For  example,  in  the  top  row,  almost  one copy  (0.98)  of  the  English Asahi  Evening  News is  printed  for  every 1,000 households all over Japan. Now, in comparison  to the circulation  of Japaneselanguage  newspapers  (as shown  in Table  12.2, Part B), the  English-language papers  fare  a very  distant  second.  For  instance,  for  the Asahi  Shimbun, of which  the Asahi  Evening  News is  a  rough  counterpart,  over  300  copies  are printed  for  every  1,000  households.

At first  glance, these numbers  might not be surprising. After  all, if English is  the  language  of  international  communication,  perhaps  the  readership  of these  English-language  newspapers  are  the  overseas  residents  living,  or travelling,  in Japan.  At the  time  these  newspaper  statistics were collected,  the number  of foreign  residents  in Japan  was about  760,000. 9 The  230,000  total copies of all the  daily English-language  papers  (that  is, all those  listed  in  the top of Table  12.2, Part A, except the once-a-week Nikkei Weekly) might then  be thought  to be for  foreign  residents'  consumption.  However,  this is simply  not true,  as can  be  revealed  in  a number  of ways.

First, many  Japanese  nationals can be seen reading these  English-language newspapers.  Many write  opinion-pieces  or  letters  to  the  editor.  Also,  as  the

offices  of  these  papers  will  tell  you,  at  least  some  parts  of  their  papers  are targeted  at local  audiences. For  example,  many want-ads for  work in  foreign companies are written completely in Japanese. Also, the Asahi newspaper  itself estimates  that  some  60  percent  of  the  readership  is Japanese  rather  than foreign  (cited  in  Tanaka,  1995: 38). 10

However,  I suspect  the  proportion  of  local  readers  is even  higher  than that.  A most  impressive  fact  is  the  following:  If we  look  at  Table  12.2,  Part C,  we  see  the  circulation  of  the  three  major  national  newspapers  in  the United  States. Seven  copies  of  the Wall Street Journal, and  four  copies  of  the New  York Times, are  found  in  every  1,000  households  in  America.  This compares  rather  poorly  to  the  325  copies  of  the Asahi  Shimbun, but  is  not drastically differently  from  the English-language  dailies in Japan, which  range from  about  one  to  one  and  a  half  papers  per  1,000  households.  An  even more  striking figure  is per  capita  newspaper  consumption.  If we say that  the 230,000 English-language  newspapers  are  read  by 760,000 foreign  residents each  day, it means  that  more  than  60 percent  of the  foreigners  are  reading a  national  newspaper.  This would  be  vastly greater  than  the  3 to  5  percent national  readership  in  the  United  States, the  10 percent  in  Britain  (cf.  Table 12.2, Part D), or even  the  20 percent  readership  in highly literate Japan.  One possible  inference  from  this  is  that  many,  if  not  most,  of  the  readers  of English  newspapers  in Japan  are Japanese. 11

However,  this  does  not  imply  mass  bilingualism,  at  least  in  the  way it is commonly defined.  For example, considering standardized  test scores, at least some  results  appear  disappointing.  The  average  1991 TOEFL  score  for  the 154,609 Japanese  nationals who  took  this examination  was 493, compared  to a 583 average for Singapore, 571 for India, or 605 for the Netherlands  (Honna, 1995). There are, to be sure, fluent  college professors or returnee  businessmen and  students,  all  of whom  are  likely  to  be  readers  of  the Japan  Times or  the Daily Yomiuri. But for  every one  of  those  there  are  thousands  whose  feel  that their  English  is non-existent,  although  in  reality  they  may actually  possess  a great  deal  of  competence  in  several  domains  or  registers.

We can thus say there is a cline of proficiency  in this 'performance  variety' of  English.  For  example,  there  are  those  who  can  read  English  well  but  not speak  it,  those  who  use  English  for  specific  purposes,  those  who  know  only 'examination  English'  and  so on.  But all this still leaves us with  the  problem of  how  to  describe  a  country  where  apparently  10  percent  of  the  daily vocabulary  used by most people  of all ages and  backgrounds  is English,  or  at least inspired  by English. In other words, what can we call a speech  community where  'English'  means  something  more  like  'intelligibility'  rather than 'language'?

This  issue  has  received  increasing  attention.  For  example,  in World Englishes, the  major journal  for  those  active  in  the  discipline  of  international English, Japan  has received a substantial amount of attention. Table  12.3 shows

a  breakdown  by  country  of  articles  in World Englishes until  the  year  2000.  In the  right-hand  column  we see  that  there  have  been  eleven  articles  on  NigerianEnglish,  eleven  on  South  African  English,  and  so  on. Yet,  the  largest  number of  articles  has  been  on Japanese  English  with  twenty-three,  followed  by  India in  second  place  with  twenty. 12

This estimate  is based on a tally from  Vol. 5 (1996)  - when  the journal  became World Englishes and took on its present format - until Vol. 6 (2000); this count is only an approximation,  as some articles discussed several venues and languages, and were not recorded; articles on American or British English were also  ignored.

This  raises  an  interesting  issue  that  many  who  have  Internet  contact  with Japanese  have  noticed.  While  all  students  of  English  may  have  dreaded t h e usually  dry  grammatical  exercises  of  dull  textbooks,  many Japanese  young people  have  found  the joy  of  communicative  English  in  writing  e-mails  to foreign  friends,  or  even  to  each  other,  or  surfing  the  Web  to  find  out  about t h e  latest  wonders  of  youth  pop  culture.  As  Tanaka  has  said  (cited  in  Alatis and  Straehle,  1997:  3):  'One  of  the  most  challenging  research  areas  which [has]  mushroomed  in  the  past  one  or  two years  in Japan  is  how  to  cope  with t h e  variety  of  English  used  over  the  internet  by  millions  of  young  students.' This  English  is often  'pidginized',  haphazard,  or  idiosyncratic.  For  example,  I received  the  following  message  from  a friend  who  had  visited  our  campus  for a  dance  recital  that  she  performed  for  us  the  previous  year:

DEAR Jim;  How  are  you  doing??  Lately.  Hope  I see  you  again  some  time recently

Unsurprisingly,  such  a  message  may  drive  a  professional  English  teacher  to distraction.  Indeed,  as Tanaka, Alatis, and  Straehle  point  out,  a  major  problem for Japanese  English  teachers  in Japan  now  is  how  to  correct  their  students' English  when  they  are  less  able  to  monitor  it.

There  is,  however,  no  doubt  that  there  is  a Japanese  variety  of  English. Suenobu  (1990: 258; Ono,  1992: 80)  defines Japanese  English  as  'the  English which  internalizes  a Japanese  language  system  and  a  living  system  of  the Japanese  and  which  grows  with Japanese  culture'.  This  is probably  as  good  a definition as  any,  a n d r e m i n d s us  that  the  J a p a n e s e  variety  of  English  is connected  to notions  of self and  identity.  It is precisely  this issue we shall  return to  now.

## Language and  Japanese identity

As we  have  seen  in  Chapter  11, language  is closely  tied  to  notions  of  race  and national  identity  in  the  minds  of  many Japanese;  the  term Nihonjinron, or t h e o r y  of Japanese-ness,  captures  this  concern  with  what  it  means  to  be Japanese,  how Japanese  should  act,  and  how Japanese  should  feel  about  the Western  world.  As  the  famous Japanese  novelist  Oe  Kenzaburo  says:

There  is an  element  in  the Japanese  nation  and  among Japanese  that  makes us  unwilling  to  accept  the  fact  we  are  members  of  the  third  world  and reluctant  to  play  our  role  accordingly.  [...] Because  of  her  wealth, Japan  is now  a  member  of  the  advanced  nations,  but,  to  be  sure,  she  is  not  an independent  nation  which  implements  plans  of  her  own  to establish  world peace.  [...] I can  think  of no  people  or  nation  as much  in  need  of a clue  for self-recovery  as the Japanese,  neither  among  the first nor  third world  nations; no other people but the Japanese, whose culture evidences a strange  blending

of  first  and  third  world  cultures;  no  other  people  but  the Japanese  who  live that  reality.  (6e,  1989:  189,  191, 212)

But  how  does  English  fit  into  this? While  in  the  last  chapter  we  have  seen a  newly  found Japanese  linguistic  confidence,  there  are  still  many  associations and  responses  that  using  English  of  any  kind  -  standard  RP,  loanwords,  or t h e J a p a n e s e  variety  of  English  -  brings  to  the  mind  of  the  speaker  and t he listener.  For  example,  as  Mouer  and  Sugimoto  indicate,  there  is:

an  insistence  in  much  English-language  education  that  one  must  think  like an  English-speaker  (usually a middle-class American)  to speak  English.  One is  told  that  one  requires  a  cultural  transfusion  to  be  able  to  communicate properly  in  English.  Unfortunately  the  transfusion  often  consists  of doses  of the Western  monolith  found  in most nihonjinron. The  results are several.  One is the  myth  that  to  talk in  English  one  must  be individualistic  and  aggressive, and  that  shy Japanese  must  be  more  outgoing  in  using  their  English. Foreigners are thus confronted  with all kinds of personal questions by probing Japanese individuals on  the trains of Tokyo.  [...]  Rather than  communicators, the end-product of this think-Western English instruction  is often  a technically accomplished interpreter robot, which is aggressive and obnoxiously loud with its  own  brand  of Japanese  individualism.  [...] there  is a belief  that  it  is all right  to say whatever  one wants in English  because  one  can be one's own self in  English.  To  some  extent  this  practice  tends  to  develop  unchallenged,  as other Japanese  around  the individual  in question  also do not understand  the English  and  share  the  same  myths.  (Mouer  and  Sugimoto,  1990:  399-400)

However,  the  situation  may  be  more  subtle  and  complicated  than  this.  An alternative  argument  is that  it is English  language  itself -  and  not  any  notions of Japanese-ness  of Nihonjinron -  that  causes  such  feelings.  We  shall  consider this  issue  in  some  detail  in  the  next  section.

## The  English language: Hegemony  and resistance

We  have  seen  previously  (in  the  last  section  and  Chapter 11)  that  some J a p a n e s e  are  uncomfortable  with  the  place  of  the  West,  and  English in particular,  in Japanese  society,  especially American  English  and  culture.  This is largely  due  to  notions  of identity  and  sense  of self. However,  there  are  others who  are  concerned  about  world-wide  hegemony  of  English,  and  the  impact this  is  having  on  Japan.

Tsuda  Yukio  is  one  of  the  most  articulate  critics  of  the  dominance of English  (1986,  1990,  1993,  1994,  1997). In  his  1990  book,  he  coined  the  term eigo-shihai (literally,  'English-domination')  to  describe  'the  superimposition  of English  upon  all  other  languages,  creating  inequality,  inconvenience,  and discrimination  against  the  non-English  speaking  people'  (1997: 22). He  argues

that  the  position  of  English  in  the  world  today  is nothing  less  than  hegemony, and  that  there  is  a  linguistic  discrimination  and  communicative inequality between  speakers  of  English  and  non-native  speakers  as a  result  of  the  'global superimposition  of  English  as an  international  language'  (1997:  23).

Tsuda  sees  three  problems  due  to  this  hegemony:  (1) communicative inequality  in  international  communication,  (2)  cultural  domination,  and (3) t h e  colonization  of  the  mind.

## Communicative  inequality

In  the  first  case,  he  argues  that  English  drowns  out  the  voices  of  all  other l a n g u a g e s .  That  is,  it  is  now  taken  for  granted t h a t  in  most  scholarly  or economic  activities  of  a  non-local  nature,  English  is  the  language  to  be  used. It  is  almost  as  if  the  Preble's  Law  that  we  have  discussed  in  Chapter  3,  the assumption  that  all  discourse  between  Americans  and Japanese  will  have  to take  place  in  English,  by  default,  was  passed  by  the  United  Nations  to  apply to  all  countries  of  the  world.  I  remember  speaking  with  a  physicist  colleague a  few  years  ago  about  discussions  he  had  at  international  conferences:  T was, at  a  meeting  in  Russia  last year,'  he  said.  'We were  talking  about  some  exciting things,  and  I  was  winning  all  the  arguments  (with  my  Russian counterparts on  scientific  issues).  But  then  I  realized  I was  winning  them  not  because  my physics  was  good,  it  was  because  my  English  was  good.'  This  realization,  by t h e  way,  has  made  him  a  convert  to  the  use  of  Esperanto.  As  Tsuda  says,  it  is assumed  there  is  no  other  choice  but  English,  which  tends  to  legitimize  its use  even  more,  which,  of  course,  is  a  vicious  circle.  As  English  gains  more prestige  and  power,  it  mutes  other  languages  even  more;  and  this  is  all  a consequence  of  the  unequal  power  structures  reproduced  by America  and  the Western  powers.

## Cultural  domination

Many  have  lamented  the  'McDonaldization' (Ritzer,  2000),  the ' C o c a Colonization'  (Wagnleitner,  1994),  or  the  'Disneyfication' (Ritzer  and  Liska, 1997) of  t h e  world.  But  Tsuda  believes t h a t t h i s  is  more t h a n mere acculturation  or  borrowing:  the  Americanization  of  culture,  he  argues,  is altering  the  cultural  space  of  each  society.  As  he  says:

For example, the  introduction  of a McDonald's  restaurant  changes  not  only the  social  landscape  on  the  surface  but  also  changes  people's  eating  habits, tastes, and  beliefs which  constitute  the base of each  original  culture. In  short, by buying and  eating a McDonald's  hamburger,  a person  becomes  not  only a consumer of an American meal, but she/he  converts into an ardent  believer of  American  culture  and  consumption-centered  way  of  life.  [...] More important,  Americanization  of global  culture  legitimates  the  hegemony  of English.  And  the  hegemony  of  English,  in  turn,  serves  to  facilitate the Americanization  of global culture, thus reproducing  the structure of linguistic and  cultural  domination.  (Tsuda,  1997: 24)

Although Tsuda's rhetoric is perhaps slightly extreme, and  his case  overstated, there  is no  doubt  that Western  products - especially American  popular  and consumer culture - have had a tremendous influence  in recent years on  other parts  of  the  world,  including Japan.

## Colonization  of the  mind

Tsuda  believes  that  the  colonization  of  the  mind  is the  most  insidious  and treacherous impact of world Englishes. Echoing Phillipson  (1992)  and  others who see the  dominance  of English  as a kind  of linguistic  imperialism,  Tsuda believes  that  as you  become  more  willing  to  use  English,  you  tend  to  move away from  your own language. That is, you identify  with and valorize  English, and you dissociate yourself from  and stigmatize your own language and culture. We become enslaved  to English, and we are not even aware that our  cultural identities  have  been  lost  -  engulfed  in  tidal  waves  of Westernization  and America.

As a  corporeal  example,  Tsuda  offers  the  notion  of eigo-byoo ('Anglo› mania'),  a  linguistic  epidemic  said  to  be  sweeping Japan (1997).  As  the Japanese  become  more  convinced  that  English  is the  key  to  cross-cultural communication,  and  become  enamoured  with  the  idea  of  English  as  the international  language  for  the world,  the  obsession  for  learning  English  has exploded,  reaching  all  facets  of Japanese  society.  Even  children  are  not i mmune.  Mombusho  (the Japanese  Ministry  of  Education)  is  currently introducing English into the primary school curriculum. In  1996, Abe  Hajime claimed  that  up  to  18  percent  of  the  vocabulary  in  children's  comics  was English, and more than  12 percent of the contents of (adult) weekly magazines are  English  (Nihon  Keizai  Shimbun,  1996; Tsuda,  1997). Abe  even  suggests the  possible  death  of  the Japanese  language  in  the  future.  While  Tsuda  does not  go  that  far,  he  warns  that  if the Japanese  people  'are  not  critically  aware of  it,  and  accept  it  uncritically,  the Japanese  Anglomania  might  possibly escalate  into  total  colonization  of their  mind'  (1997: 25).

## Japanese  responses to the hegemony  of English:  Resistance or reinforcement?

Tsuda points out  (1997)  that there are indeed many in Japan who argue against the alleged  hegemony of English. These include  television  anchors,  literature scholars,  sociologists,  and  others who  are  engaged  in various  consciousnessraising  efforts  to  curb  the  growing  trend  of  incorporating  more  and  more English  into Japanese  life.  Tsuda  himself  offers  what  he  calls an  'ecology  of language'  approach  as  a  counter-balance  and  'counter-discourse  to  the hegemony  of English'.  This  paradigm  is based  on  theoretical  positions  like the  TESOL  Resolution  on  Language  Rights  which,  among  other  things,

advocates  the  protection  and  preservation  of languages  and  cultures  regardless of  origin  or  relocation.  In  this  revolution,  it  is  explicitly  stated  that  English should  be  learned  as  a  second  language  and  native  languages  and cultures should  be  maintained.  More  importantly,  Tsuda  asks  why  we  want  to  learn English,  urges  language  instructors  to  be  aware  of  the  ethics  and  politics  of t e a c h i n g  English,  and  to  be  cognizant  of  the  inherently  unequal power structures  that  make  English  an  international  language.  He  suggests  (following Phillipson)  that  the  professionalization  of English  teaching  dissociates  teachers and  students  from  political  realities  in  favour  of  a  fetishism of t e c h n i c a l proficiency.  He  calls  for  a  'critical  applied  linguistics'  which  examines t h e political,  cultural,  economic,  and  ethical  contexts  of  language  teaching  and l e a r n i n g  (1997:  29).

However,  as well-intentioned  Tsuda's  proposals  are,  the  dominant t r e n d in  actual  language  behaviour  seems  to  be  towards  the  reinforcement and continued  're-exoticization'  of Japanese  by  'foreign'  languages. While  the  most obvious  example  here  is English, Japanese  also  borrows  from  other  languages as  well.

## French  or  other  choices?

Casual  strollers  on  any Japanese  street  these  days  might  notice  a  new  trend. While  English  words and  phrases  abound  in both katakana syllabary and  roman letters,  French  seems  to  have  become  more  popular.  Many  coffee  shops,  hair salons,  restaurants,  magazine  advertisements,  chateaux,  apartment  complexes, and  health  spas  now  are  employing  a  French  panache.  For  example,  Figure 12.2 shows a beauty shop  named La  Coiffure de EXCEL ('The EXCEL Beauty  Salon') in  Hiratsuka,  a  medium-sized  town  near  Tokyo.  Such  names  are  rather  typical these  days  for  things  dealing  with  beauty  products,  exotic  foods,  and other aspects  of  'high  culture'.  As  one  informant  said:

I  am  seeing  more  and  more  French  these  days. I see  it a lot.  Everywhere.  I think  it  sounds  really  sophisticated  . . . kind  of  European.  I think  for  fancy things, we use French  instead  of English  now  English  doesn't  sound  so  fancy to  us  anymore.  Maybe  we  will  stop  using  so  much  English  and  switch  to French.

## Another  young  woman  said:

In  the mid-1990s we had  an  Italian  Boom  in Japan.  Everything was Italian  for a while. Even the apartment building next to where I live had  an Italian  name -Erunido ( XJUZ. K ). 13 Of course, my Italian  friend  laughed when  he  heard it;  he  says it  means  'nest  of  love'  in  Italian!  Imagine  living  in  an  apartment named  that.  But the  term Ita-meshi [literally  'Italian  food'  or  Italian  cuisine] was very popular  around  that  time.

these  young  women  may  not  be  representative  of  all  ofJapan, here  certainly  is  evidence  that  the  use  of  French  names  has increased  during  the  last decade,  Haarman  (1989)  has written  extensively  on the  use  of French  in Japanese  advertising. It is possible  that  English  is losing some  of its exotic  flavour,  so  that  other  languages  will  be  used  increasingly for  eye-catching  phrases  and  unusual  names.  However,  we should  also  look closer at Figure  12,2o Except for  the  name, almost all other  terms on  the  sign are  in  English  (written  in katakana): price,  cut, section perm, style perm,  colouring, shampoo, blow [dry], set 7fhe only non-English is  fltftlt kitsuke; that is the  service sss a woman  in  the  complicated  kimono  for  formal  occasions,

: seems to be a somewhat cautious use of French  here. In fact,  under the French  name itself  is  the Japanese  rendition, Ullllx^ifeJ^  (literally, Biyooshitsu Ekuseru) '  The  English  is actually more  extensive . beauty  salon. Yet,  the  idea  of  the  exotic=ness  of  Eng] certainly  merits  more  attention.  In  fact,  it  might  be  said  that  the  English  is being  w-remade  in Japan, which  is perhaps  another  possible  response  to  the possible  hegemony  of  English,

## Remade in Japan

pnning  of  this  chapter status; while  perhaps

franca,  it is rather  close. It is perhaps  easy to be  misled  by the  triumphalism of World Englishes, to say nothing of the staggering facts and  figures  that  are often  quoted.  However,  sometimes  we may miss critical  social,  cultural  and economic  factors  as well as linguistic  factors  that  may mitigate  some  of  these claims.

' Native-speaker'-ness,  of  course,  has  become  a  more  dubious  and problematic  concept  (Paikeday,  1985); one  that  is hard  to  define  and  even harder  to  substantiate.  Even  the  ability  to  'speak'  English  maybe  largely  a nebulous  notion.  For  example,  Richard  Parker  (cited  in Wallraff,  2000: 56) found  that a 1995 study of 4,500 Europeans of their  'perceived' versus  'actual' English-language  skills  was  'sobering':  Fewer  than  3 percent  of  people  in France,  Spain  or  Italy  had  a  good  enough  command  of  English  to  follow television  programmes.  Only in  Scandinavia  and  the  Low Countries  did  the numbers  exceed  10  percent.

The  Internet,  once  touted  the  great  boom  to  English-language  spread throughout  the world, now seems to be levelling off.  More and  more  speakers of  other  languages  are  now  using  the  Internet,  and  some  estimate  that  44 percent of these users speak a language  other  than  English  at home; some  13 percent speak an Asian language  (mostly Japanese)  (Wallraff,  2000). Also,  no one  knows what the  technological  future  holds. In  many ways, the  popularity of  English  has  been  an  historical  accident.  If  the  Germans  had  developed atomic energy or the atomic bomb during the Second World War, the  language of physics would most likely have been  German  for  the next century, as it was from  the  1800s through  the  1930s. If the Japanese  had  invented  the  Internet, it  would  be  hard  to  predict just  what  the  world  linguistic  scene  would  look like  today.

In  any case, the  current  existence  and  growth  of diverse World  Englishes brings home a very obvious fact: Just because  'English speakers' all 'speak'  the same language  does not mean  they all understand  each  other. The  evidence seems  to  indicate  that  as English  becomes  more  widespread,  the  greater  the variation  in norms and standards of communication.  In short, the claims made by  Tsuda  and  others  about  the  hegemony  of  English  may  be  somewhat premature. The  domination  of English  as an  international  language  may  be only short-lived,  or  may be  more  perceived  than  real.

In  the  mid-1990s Joseph  Tobin  edited  a  book  titled Re-Made in  Japan: Everyday Life and  Consumer Taste in a Changing Society. In  it were  articles  which examined  how various Western  elements became  appropriated  into Japanese, sometimes going through several initiation rituals. One major  point in the  final analysis is: it is hard  to separate what is 'foreign'  and  borrowed,  from  what is 'indigenous'  and  native  in  contemporary Japan  today.

This book  has shown, I hope,  that  the Japanese  people  are just  as  adept at  linguistic  incorporation  as they  are  incorporating  baths  and  Argentinian tangos  into Japanese  culture  (Tobin,  1992).  I  believe Japanese  language

creativity  is beyond  question.  In  fact,  I predict  we will  see  more  of what  could be  called  re-exoticization.  As  English  phrases  and  words  become more commonplace  and  nativized,  I  believe  new  devices  will  be  constructed to capture  some  of  the  surprise  and  colour  that  English  used  to  have.

Figure  12.3  shows  an  example  of  what  this  might  be  like. At  first  glance, this  is a  typical  advertisement  from  a weekly  news  magazine  (from  the  30 June 2001  issue  of Shuukan Gendai) for  an  automobile,  an  IPSUM  240  Series  van from  Toyota.  The  big  headline  on  top  of  the  page  says: Minivan, tumoroo  ^,J\&gt; h O ^ P ['Minivan,  Tomorrow'].  On  the  bottom  of  the  page  we  have pictures  telling  of  features like supeesu tumoroo  7,^\-X h ^ ^ P  - ['space t o m o r r o w ' ] ,  or seefuti tumoroo  ii - y-r^ h ^ t P ['safety t o m o r r o w ' ] , or doraibingu tumoroo K:7-ftf&gt;^ h^^EP-  ['driving t o m o r r o w ' ] .

Figure  12.3 Minivan  Tomorrow

<!-- image -->

One  interesting  aspect  of  this  advertisement  is  the  unusual  English  word tumoroo h o ^ P  -  ('tomorrow') and  its  spelling.  Although this  is  a fairly t r a n s p a r e n t  loanword  to  most Japanese,  many Japanese  loanword  dictionaries do  not  have  it,  including  the  exhaustive  Arakawa  (1977)  dictionary;  Iida  and Yamamoto  (1983)  do  have  this entry,  however,  although  most  later  ones  do  not. What is especially intriguing  is the way this loanword  is spelled.  Many  ' t o '  words in  English  become katakanayized as tsuin Japanese  (see  Table  3.5  and  Chapter 4):  e.g.  'two  way' tsuu  weeV£x-  , 'tour' tsuaa x &gt;7-  , 'tweed' tsuiido  V4  K · Here,  however, we see  the word  'tomorrow'  spelled  in a different,  innovative way. We would  expect  something  like tsumoroo y^EP-  or tsuumoroo  V^EP- , but  instead  we  get  a tumoroo.

Why  might  this  be?  Why  are  all  these  linguistic  gymnastics being performed?  Is  it  simply  for  humour,  or  the  sheer  joy  of  word  play?  One i nformant's  comments  help  answer  these  questions,  I  believe:

Of course  they use it to be eye-catching. Because it is not  100 percent  correct or  expected,  you  pause  for  a moment,  right? What  is going  here?  Once  you are caught  like that you probably spend  a little time thinking about what  this means. Then  it hits you. Oh yeah, it's a pun joke!  'Tomorrow'  and  'Too move' .  . . something  like  that. And, you know, once you figure  something  like  that out, you feel  good, you feel  intelligent. And you feel  that  ad  is really a  good one. And, also, I imagine you keep  that ad  in mind  . . . hey, maybe you  even keep  it in  mind  tomorrow!

And  maybe  you  will buy  the  car. What  might  be  happening  here  is an  attempt to  suggest  the  idea  of  'two  more'  or  'too,  more'  by  using  this katakana. The Japanese  word  for  tomorrow (ashita) is  used  only  in  the  small  print.  When comparing  this  car  to  'yesterday's'  product,  the  native Japanese  word  is  used ( l kinoo no  minivan). As  the  advertisement  says,  everything  we  thought  about mini-vans  until  yesterday  is now  gone.

## Conclusion

In  short,  I  believe  this  book  supports  the  following  claims  and  arguments:

- English  is  necessary  to  speak Japanese  today;
- English  is a  creative  force  in Japanese  sociolinguistics,  and  in various  forms of  artistic  expression;
- English  linguistic  forms  are  a  created-in-Japan  variety  for  use  by Japanese in Japan  regardless  of  how  they  may  appear  to  native  English  speakers;
- The  presence  of  English  is  neither  a  marker  of  language  pollution nor an  indication  of  cultural  colonization;
- English  is  not  a  reflection  of  a Japanese  'copy-cat'  mentality;
- English  has  a  critical  place  in  the Japanese  symbol  system;

- English  has  a  critical  place  in  various Japanese  cognitive  schemas;
- English  loanwords  are  used  by  all Japanese  people;  that  said,  however, t h e r e  are  often great  differences in  English  usage  and acceptability depending  on  age, gender,  education,  occupation,  social  status,  class,  and personal  feelings;
- Certain  populations,  such  as Japanese  women,  can  use  English  as a  means to  circumvent  certain  linguistic  and  social  constraints  in  the  Japanese language;
- The  presence  of English  has affected Japanese  phonology  and  morphology in  very  unusual  ways;
- English  is  the  primary  force  behind  orthographic  change  in  Japan;
- English  plays  a  very  important  role  in Japanese  denotative,  connotative, and  perceptual  processes;
- Japanese  ideas  of  race  and  national  identity  are  crucially  tied  to  language;
- Ironically,  however,  English  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  reification  of  the sense  of  identity  and  self  in  Japan;
- Japanese  English  is  a  unique  and  special  case,  generally  defying  any  of the  proposed  sociolinguistic  continuums  used  to describe  language-contact situations;
- The Japanese  case  also  demonstrates  certain  universal  features  found  in all  places  where  languages  and  cultures  meet,  and  in  that  sense,  has  much to  contribute  to  a  general  theory  of  language  and  culture  contact.
- J a p a n e s e English  occupies  a  place  in  the  larger  context  of ' w o r l d Englishes';  that  is,  English  is  not  only  an  Asian  language,  it  is  also  a Japanese  language;
- Japanese  English  has  much  to say about  a general  theory  of language  and culture  contact  (processes  of  nativization,  pragmatics,  language  change, communicative  strategies,  the  interrelationships  of  language  and  culture, etc.);
- Finally, Japanese,  English,  and Japanese  English  are  growing  and  evolving t o g e t h e r ;  t h e  relationships  are  more  symbiotic  than  parasitic,  and t h e i r futures  now  are  inexorably  and  irretrievably  linked.

It  seems  appropriate  to  end  this  book  with  a  comment  once  again  from Fukuzawa  Yukichi,  the  Meiji  man  of  letters  we  met  at  the  beginning  of  the book,  who  did  so  much  to  bring  the  English  language  to  the Japanese  in  the nineteenth  century  (1899:  214):

From  my own  observations  in  both  Occidental  and  Oriental  civilizations,  I find  that each has certain strong points and weak points bound up in its moral teachings and  scientific  theories.  . . . After  all, the  present  is the  result  of  the past.  This  glorious  condition  of  our  country  cannot  but  be  the  fruit  of  the good inheritance from  our ancestors. We are the fortunate  ones who live today to  enjoy  this wonderful  bequest.

## Appendix: The Japanese  syllabary  writing

system

Modern Japanese uses several orthographies besides the famous  Sinojapanese characters  borrowed  from  the Asian  mainland  around  A D 560. Two of  these scripts  (the hiragana and  the katakana systems)  are  syllabaries - rather  than an  alphabet - which are used  to express things phonetically in the  language. As with most syllabary systems in  the world, a single Japanese kana (syllabary) symbol usually represents  a single vowel sound,  or  a consonant  plus a vowel. The  traditional  ordering  of the Japanese  sound  system is given  in Figure  A.l. This  chart,  though  modified  somewhat  over  time, is actually very old,  going back at least to the  sixth  century AD. The  ordering  of the  sounds  in  this  chart is basically the  same as that found  in writing systems based on  the  Devanagari (and other  derivative)  scripts, such as Hindi, Burmese, Bengali, and  of course, Sanskrit  (cf.  Nakanishi,  1980: 45-79; Gaur,  1984: 106-17). That is, this analysis was apparently  based  on  a study of Buddhist  texts, both  directly from  Indian sources and  secondarily via  Chinese.

As Figure  A.l  shows,  this  Tndic  inspired  phonological  analysis'  (Miller, 1967: 129)  arranged  the syllables into five vertical  columns (dan, or  'classes'), each  named  for  the vowel which  heads  it: A-dan,  I-dan,  U-dan,  E-dan, and Odan, respectively. The ten horizontal rows were named for the consonant which would  precede  the  vowel  (with  no  consonant  -  that  is, the  plain  vowel  starting  the  first  row). Thus,  the  five  rows and  ten  columns  produce  the  socalled  '50-sound  chart'  (the go-juu on zu). Reading across and  down  the  chart, from  left  to  right,  the  'alphabetical'  order  would  be  'a,  i, u,  e,  o,  ka,  ki,  ku, ke, ko, sa,  ...'  and  so on  until  'wa'. 1 This is actually  the way words  are  usually ordered  in  a Japanese  dictionary.

At the end  of the chart in  the last row, I have placed  the  'final-n'  nasal what Japanese  linguists  often  call  the  'syllabic-n'  -  that  can  occur  at  either the  end  of  a word  or  a syllable. This  is the  only  'independent'  consonant  in Japanese which  can appear without a vowel. Thus, this /-n/  sound  is the  only consonant  that  can  terminate  a  syllable  or  word  in Japanese  (as  seen  for example,  in Nihon, the  native  word  for Japan,  or  in  the  title Rashoomon, the

famous Japanese  film).  Because  of this special  property,  it merits its own  symbol in  the  syllabary  charts.

The  syllabary  system  actually  contains  a  number  of  symbols  beyond t h e fifty  sounds  given  in  Figure  A.l.  There  are  a  series  of  'voiced  sounds' (daku-

on) corresponding  to  the  k-, s-,  t- and  h-  rows  of  the  50-sound  chart.  In  other words, where  the  original  chart  had  'ka,  ki, ku,  ke,  ko'  there  is a voiced  series of ' g a , gi,  gu, ge,  g o ' , a n d so  on.  These  voiced  sounds  are i n d i c a t e d orthographically  by simply  adding  a voicing  marker  (written  as  small  quote mark,  ")  to  the  first  symbol.  Thus,  / g a / becomes  written  as  / k a / plus  "(i.e. ^ + " ),  with  t h e  new  symbol  becoming tfi. T h e  J a p a n e s e  also  feel  that t h e voiceless  bilabial  stops  -  that  is,  / p /  sounds  -  are  somehow  related  to  the / h - / and  / b - /  sounds.  That  is,  the  'pa,  pi,  pu,  pe,  p o '  series  is  t h o u g h t to be  derived  from  the  'ha,  hi,  hu,  he,  h o '  series.  These  / p /  sounds ( t e r m e d handaku-on) are  written  by  adding  a  small  circle  to  the  symbols  of  the / h / sounds. For  example,  / p a / is  written  as  / h a / plus  a  small  circle (i.e.  [£).* All  these  derived  symbols  for  the hiragana syllabary  in  Figure  A.l  are  shown below:

There  is one  last  set  of  syllables  needed  to  make  this way of  depicting  the Japanese  phonological  system  complete. There  are  another  36 symbols for  the so-called yoo-on series,  the  palatalized  consonants.  The  three  basic  palatal sounds  ya,  yu, and yo -  are  written  in hiragana respectively  as "p,  ty, a n d  &lt; £ (as  i n d i c a t e d in  line  8  in  Figure  A . l ) .  Again,  to  write  the  other palatal consonant  syllables -  such  as kya,  kyu, or kyo -  the  symbols  are  derived  from t h e  original  fifty  orthographies  of  Figure  A.l.  The  initial  consonant  is  taken from  the  'consonant  plus  i-sound  symbol',  and  the  palatalization marker written  next  to  it,  but  written  in  a  smaller  way.  Thus,  / k y a / is  r e n d e r e d  as ki £ + small ya  *$&gt; b e c o ming kya  c* ^ &gt; (that  is, using  the  symbol  for  'kz 'plus  a  small symbol for  'y«'written  in  the  lower  right-hand  corner) . 3 These yoo-on palatalized sounds  are  given  in  Figure  A.2  (p.  304).

For  historical  reasons  there  are  actually  two kana phonetic syllabary systems.  Figure  A.l  gives  the hiragana forms,  which  are  used  to  write  most grammatical  particles,  adverbs,  and  other  things  for  which Sino-Japanese characters  do  not  exist  or  would  be  awkward  to  use.  The  second  set,  termed katakana, are  alike  in  every  respect  to  the hiragana. In  other  words,  for  every hiragana symbol  there  is a  corresponding  one  in katakana and  everything  that can  be  written  in hiragana can  also  be  written  in katakana. Figure  A.3  gives t h e  complete katakana set,  t h o u g h  for  this  table  I  have  combined  all t h e features (such  as  voicing,  palatalization,  etc.,  that  I  previously discussed

Today  the katakana syllables  are  used  for  a  variety  of  things.  In  Japanese t e x t b o o k s  l a n g u a g e  l e a r n e r s  are  told  that  they  are  used  to  write  borrowed words  and  names,  or  onomatopoeic  expressions,  but  they  are  actually  much more  common  than  that.  They  can  be  used  in  itemized  bills, writing  computer software,  and  for  dozens  of other  things. The  list below gives  just  a few katakana examples:

## CHAPTER  1

1. I  have  included  English  glosses  here,  though  they  are  not  given  in  the  original text.  A few  typographic  conventions  should  be  mentioned.  All Japanese  words, whether  borrowed  or  native,  are  italicized,  with  glosses  given  in  parentheses  in quotes. The  Hepburn  system of romanization  is used, with Japanese vowel  length given  by repeating  the vowel rather  using  a diacritic  (except  for  a direct  quote): that is, kuukoo ('airport')  is used  here,  rather  than kiiko, as in  some  other  systems. Familiar names or places are cited as they are normally spelled in English  ('Tokyo' versus  the  technically  more  correct Tookyoo) .  An  apostrophe  is used  to  separate the  so-called  syllable-ending  / n /  from  a syllable  starting with  an  / n /  sound:  e.g., kinen [i.e., ki f£  + nen ^ ,  'anniversary']  versus kin en [i.e., kin ^ +  m l ],  'no smoking'). Words  and  morphemes  are  not  usually  separated  in  normal  written Japanese,  but  I  have  added  spaces  and  hyphens  occasionally  for  clarity  of explanation,  or to emphasize how one lexical item is related  to another.  However, it  should  be  noted  that  how  romanized  Japanese  words  are  to  be  spelled, hyphenated  or  separated  is still somewhat  a matter  of dispute,  and  almost  every author  does things slightly differently.  Also, in most cases, all Japanese  names  are given  in  the  traditional  order  of  family  name  first.  Otherwise,  unless  stated differently,  I have followed  the suggestions  in  the SWET Guide (Society of Writers, Editors, and  Translators,  1998).
2. A 'mansion'  in Japanese  English  is really an  apartment  or  condominium  rather than  a huge  house  as in  British  or American  English.
3. Actually,  as we shall  see  in  Chapter  3, this  is from  the  Portuguese  loanword  for ' bread',  going  back  to  the  sixteenth  century  (Arakawa,  1977: 1009).
4. For  my views on  these  books, see Stanlaw  (1991)  and  (1997b).

## CHAPTER  2

1. Some sections and examples in this chapter  have appeared  in Stanlaw  (1988)  and (1992b).
2. This is based on the data gathered in the  1960s by the National Language  Research Institute  (Kokuritsu  Kokugo  Kenkyuujo,  1970, 1971, 1972,  1973)  in  their  several

word counts taken from  newspapers. This set of studies has never been  duplicated, and  today  the  percentage  of  loanwords  would  almost  certainly  be  substantially higher.

3. This  observation  is based  on  figures  given  by  the  National  Language  Research Institute  (Kokuritsu  Kokugo  Kenkyuujo,  1970-4)  and  Kindaichi,  et  al.  (1995). Although  the  particular  estimates vary, it is clear  that  loanwords  may make  up  to 10 percent  of  all Japanese  vocabulary,  and  the  vast  majority  (between  80  to  95 percent)  come  from  English.
4. This  is based  on  a  study  that  covered  the  early  1980s by K. Inoue  (1985).  Note that  not all the  apparently  transparent  English words might look similar  to  native speakers of English. For example, " t J " \i7&gt; often  means a discount or 'service' given to  regular  or  good  customers.
5. The  oldest  loanword  dictionary  is probably  Ueda,  et  al.  (1915),  but  there  have been  dozens since. General  dictionaries  include  Ishiwata  (1990), Kaieda  (1997), Kobayashi  (1982), Maruyama  (1992), Nikaidoo  (1980), Oda  (1998), Oka  (1980), Sanseido  (1979), Shinsei  (1978), Tooren-kikaku  (1997), Umegaki  (1980), Yokoi (1978),  and  Yoshizawa  (1979).  There  are  also  many  specialized  ones,  such  as Fujimura  (1982)  for  older  people. Makino Shinobu  (2000)  has an  accompanying CD-ROM giving correct  pronunciations.  Loanword  dictionaries  or  glossaries  in English include Bailey (1962), Matsumoto  (1974), Miura  (1979, 1985, 1998), Webb (1990), Motwani  (1991,  1994), and  Kamiya  (1994).
6. It should be mentioned  that this book does not focus on code-switching and  codemixing between Japanese  immigrants  overseas or Japanese-English  bilinguals  (as in,  for  instance,  Nishimura's  1977 study  of Toronto nisei, i.e.  second-generation Japanese  Canadians). That  said, I do  not want  to give the  impression  that Japan is a completely homogeneous, monolingual  society, as this is not  the case  (Mahler andYashiro,  1991; 1995).
7. There is a fairly extensive literature by  Japanese scholars on English in Japan,  going back several decades. For example, Hida  (1981), Higa  (1973, 1979), Honna  (1990), Ishino  (1977,  1978,  1982),  Ishiwata  (1978,  1981,  1983,  1985,  1986,  1989), Nakayama  (1990), Shimomiya  (1978), Shinmura  (1983), Suenobu  (1990), Suzuki (1978a), Tananbe  (1981), Umegaki  (1967, 1978), Yano  (1990), Yokoi  (1973), and Yoshizawa  (1978)  give some Japanese  views on  English  in Japanese.
8. The  death  of the  Shoowa Emperor  (known  in  the West as Hirohito)  merits  some comment as it has implications for  the  term  'Golden Week'  as well, showing  some of the linguistic creativity of the  Japanese people. Hirohito's son, Akihito  (the  125th new sovereign)  was born  on  23 December,  a time  when  few  people  could  take time  off  before  Christmas  and  the  New Year. In  this sense,  then,  the  Emperor's birthday was inconvenient,  coming at such a cold weather and so close to the  New Year  (the  main  holiday  in Japan).  In  order  to  continue  the  'Golden  Week' tradition,  the  old  emperor's  birthday  is still  celebrated  as Midori no Hi (literally meaning  'Green  Day'; that  is, a spring  holiday).
9. There  is a vast  literature  on  English-language  teaching  in Japan  and  the  use  of English  in  the  educational  establishment.  See, for  example,  Brownell  (1967), Honna,  Tajima,  and  Minamoto  (2000),  Hoshiyama  (1978),  Ike  (1995),  Ikeda (1968), Koike and Tanaka  (1995), LoCastro  (1990,1996), and Yano (1992). Tanaka and  Tanaka's  (1995)  bibliography  is quite  detailed.  Many English  and Japanese teachers argue about whether or not English  loanwords are good or bad for  their particular  subjects  (e.g., Takeshita,  1993; H.  Quackenbush,  1997).

10. There  is much  written  on Japanese  communicative  strategies  and  discourse  in general.  Maynard  (1990,  1997,  1998)  are  standard  works. Locastro  (1987)  and Stanlaw  (1992c)  deal  with  communicative  strategies  with  special  reference  to English  loanwords  in Japanese.  Smith  (1978),  Kunihiro  (1979), Taylor  (1979), Tanabe  (1981)  and  Ishiwata  (1983)  focus  on  Japanese-English contrastive linguistics.

## CHAPTER  3

1. For fuller  accounts  in English  of  the  Chinese-Japanese  contact  story, see  Habein (1984), Seeley  (1984,  1991)  and  Loveday  (1996).
2. Some interesting accounts of culture and language contact during  the  nineteenth century  can  be found  in  Heusken  (1964), Dulles  (1965), Statler  (1969),  Braisted (1976)  and  Lehmann  (1981). On  language  contact and  linguistics, see  Grimshaw (1971), Silverstein  (1972), Heath  (1984); Heller  (1985); Holm  (1988,  1989);  for pidgins, see  Hymes  (1971;  1971 ed.)  and Valdman  (1977).
3. This was the  so-called Ansei no Taigoku ('Ansei  Purge').
4. See,  for  instance,  Nagashima's  (1993)  discussion  of  the  transition  from  DutchJapanese  to English-Japanese  dictionaries.
5. See Atkinson  (1874), LeLand  (1879), Chamberlain  (1904), Williams  (1958a; 1963); Stanlaw  (1987b)  and Adachi  (1988).
6. For  other  descriptions  of  nineteenth-century Yokohama  and  the  lives of  foreign residents in  the settlements  (or  'Concessions'), see Williams  (1958a,  1958b,  1963) andCortazzi  (1987).
7. Other sources include a commentary on the Atkinson pamphlet by LeLand  (1879) in an American  popular  magazine, an appendix  to LeLand's review  (Diosy, 1879), and  a few  contemporary Japanese  plays or  novels. Adachi  (1988)  has  compiled what is in essence a dictionary of the Atkinson  text, and Daniels  (1948)  also surveys the vocabulary found  in  the  pamphlet.  Some Japanese  discussions  of the  various Yokohama dialects include Horiuchi Katsuaki  (1965), Takahashi  (1967), Umegaki (1967), Hazawa  (1974), Ueda  (1901)  and  Ishiwata Toshio  (1981). Although  most sources cited  are  largely concerned  with  the  languages from  the Yokohama  area, other  open  ports  such  as Nagasaki  and  Kobe  apparently  used  an  interlanguage with  a very similar  structure.  For  this reason,  Daniels  (1948)  suggests  calling  it a 'Ports  Lingo'.
8. See also Ikeda  (1968)  and  Ike  (1995).
9. Adachi  (1988)  also  gives  a  lexicon  of what  she  believes  was  the  vocabulary  of Interpreter's  English, circa  1886.
10. This is now Hitotsubashi  University.
11. This  quotation  from  Mori  to  Whitney  is from  a  letter  in  the  Yale  University Library Whitney  Manuscripts  Collection,  cited  in  Hall  (1973:  191-2).  See  also Mori  (1973).
12. In  many  other  cases  the  romanization  systems  are  the  same;  for  example,  ^ is written  as ma in  all  three  systems.
13. This book  also uses the  Hepburn  system.
14. The  long-running  girl's comic book series Haikara-san ga Tooru ('Ms  High  Collar

Is Passing', which  is about  love and  intrigue  in  early twentieth-century Japan)  has kept  the  term  current.  It is still in print  and  this lexical item  therefore  remains  in the vernacular of even  today's teenagers. However, I have rarely heard  anyone  use it  out  of  an  historical  context.

15. Arakawa  (1977)  gives the first  printed  attestation  of this  term  as  1954 and  claims that  the  etymology  is panpan ('prostitute,  streetwalker')  + ingurisshu ('English').
16. See Kindaichi Haruhiko  (1978: 130)  and  Miller  (1982: 115)  for  other  translations of  this  passage.

## CHAPTER  4

1. Some  tables and  examples  in  this chapter  have appeared  in  Stanlaw  (2002).
2. Indeed,  even  modern  Chinese  uses  the  device  of  choosing  a  character  with  a similar  sound  to, say, approximate  a foreign  place  name.  Ideally,  the  characters are  also chosen  to convey some kind of semantic sense as well, as in, for  example, America  being  written  as  HIS  Meiguo  ('beautiful  country)',  or  England ~^M Yingguo  ('brave  country'). Many times, however, characters are chosen  simply  for their  phonetic  value,  as in  the  case  of  Chile  §f'J  Zhili  (whose  characters  mean nothing).
3. Syllabaries  are  actually  one  of  the  most  common  writing  systems  in  use  in  the world; depending on how one counts, about half of the world's languages use some form  of  a  syllabic  writing  system.  DeFrancis  (1984,  1989)  argues  that  it  was  no coincidence  that  three  places where writing was independently  invented  (China, Mayan Meso-America, and  Sumerian  Iran)  all, at least initially, based  their writing systems  on  syllabic  principles:  'There  can  be  little  doubt  that  it  is  easier  to conceptualize  a syllable  than  to analyze  utterances  into  smaller  phonemic  units' (DeFrancis,  1989: 670).
4. The suffix-word -kana (or its phonological variant -gana) literally means  'provisional name', but I gloss it here  as 'letter'  for  simplicity; I also sometimes  add  a  hyphen for  clarity.  This  is  the  same  suffix  that  is  found  in kata-KANA,  hira-GANA, or Man yoo-GANA, though  sometimes  its pronunciation  changes  due  to  the  sounds surrounding  it. That  is, when  a word  (or  morpheme)  starting  with  a  voiceless consonant follows a word  (or morpheme)  ending with a voiced sound,  this initial voiceless sound  becomes voiced  (e.g. a  [-k]  becomes  [-g]  as in the example  here). These  so-called rendaku rules  are  discussed  more  fully  in  the  next  footnote.
5. Actually,  phonological  definitions  and  descriptions  become  slightly  tricky at  this point, especially if one holds on too tightly to an English or Indo-European  model (cf.  Ito  and  Mester,  1999).

First,  it  must  be  noted  that  vowel-length  is phonemic  in Japanese  (i.e.  the period  of  time  a vowel  is held  can  make  a difference  in  meaning).

Next,  the  reader  is  reminded  that  the  so-called  final  syllabic-n  sound  is discussed  in  detail  in  the  Appendix.

Third,  three  other  points of  Japanese  phonology  should  be  mentioned.  First, Japanese  has so-called  'long'  or geminated  consonants, where a consonant  sound is held, stretched,  or elongated.  (These are usually denoted  by repeating the  letter in  romanization,  or  using  a  small 'tsu' symbol  in  the kana orthography.)  For example, the  [t]-sound  in  the English  collocation  'hot  topping'  (say, when  asking for  an  additional  flavour  on  an  ice-cream  sundae)  is  a  kind  of  geminated

consonant.  In Japanese, however, a geminated  consonant contrasts with a  normal consonant  to show a difference  in  meaning:  e.g. kite ('please  come  here')  versus kitte ('stamp'),  or kakoo ('let's  draw'  or  'let's  write')  versus kakkoo ('the  cuckoo bird').

The second  point is what Japanese  call rendaku, or  sequential  voicing. That is, if  a word  beginning  with  a voiceless  sound  follows  a voiced  syllable,  it  becomes voiced.  For  example,  the Japanese  food sushi begins with  a voiceless  sound  (i.e. V). When  it is the compound inari-sushi ('vinegared  rice in deep-fried  tofu'),  the voiceless  -s becomes  a voiced  -z: inari-zushi. There  is a whole  series  of  voiceless consonants which  can become voiced  (e.g. s =&gt; z, t =&gt; d, k =&gt; g, etc., as discussed in  the  Appendix).

A third  point  is the  notion  of Japanese mora (Ohye,  1976b; Kubozono,  1999) - vs. English  'syllable'  - commonly  accepted  by most Japanese  linguists. Mora are  defined  as  having  three  manifestations:  (1)  a mora is  one  of  the  vowel  or consonant-vowel syllabary units found  in charts like Table 4.1;  (2)  the final syllabic -n is a mora; and  (3)  the  first  part  of  the  long geminated  consonant  is also a mora. The idea of the mora has been  introduced  by  Japanese  linguists for both  descriptive and  theoretical  reasons. Theoretically, mora can  be  used  to  account  for  -  and explain  and  predict  - many  phonological  phenomena  found  in Japanese.  It is also  thought  to  be  a psychologically  real  unit  of  time, with  each mora in  a  word given  the  same  duration  by native  speakers. Tsujimura  (1996: 64-7)  gives a  good description  of mora and  syllable  differences.  For  some  further  discussions  of Japanese  phonology and English see Ichikawa  (1930), Ohye  (1976b), Lovins  (1973 [1975]), Isshiki  (1957,  1965), and Josephs  (1970).

6. The following  comments  apply not only to the  text, but all the  syllabary charts  in this  chapter,  as well  as in  the  Appendix:  it should  be  noted  that  the Japanese  f sound  is somewhat  different  from  English.  It appears  only as a voiceless  bilabial fricative  when  it comes before  the  rounded  high  back-vowel  [u], and  is written  in roman  letters as/w. That is, in native Japanese  orthography  there  are no  [fa],  [fi], [fe],  or  [fo]  sounds  appearing  in  charts  like Figure A.l  or Table  4.2  (only  [fu]). Also, as  [fu]  is a bilabial sound  made with the  two lips  (something like the  English 'who')  the Japanese  [f]  is not  exactly  the  same  as the  English  labio-dental  sound made by putting  the  bottom  lip under  the  top  row of  teeth.

The Japanese  h-sounds  are voiceless  and  the Japanese  word hito ('person') sounds much  like a hissing or whispered  beginning  of the sentence  'HE  TOW-ed my car away'  in  English.  Furthermore,  in  the  r-rows of these  charts  the Japanese r-sound  is an  alveolar  flap  rather  than  the  English  retroflex  r-sound.

7. Fukuzawa himself experimented with several katakana transliterations  for  different 'innovative'  non-Japanese  sounds. For  example,  for vo he  sometimes wrote *j  ·% or # ^ , for vi he  would  use  £f*f or  ·?#,  and  for ve  *J x  or Jl ;  he  would sometimes  use  93JU for  English  final  '-ver'  sounds.

## CHAPTER  5

1. Different  portions of this chapter were presented  at the following  conferences  and published  in  their  proceedings: The  Poetics  of Japanese  Literature  Conference, 3-4  October  1992, Purdue  University  (Stanlaw,  1993a), and  The  Fourth  Annual Meetings  of  the  Midwest Association  for Japanese  Literary  Studies:  Revisionism

- in Japanese  Literary  Studies,  November  1996  (Stanlaw,  1996a).  I wish  to  thank the  participants  of  these  conferences  for  their  kind  help  and  advice,  especially Roger Thomas, Phyllis Lyons, and John  Wallace.
2. Tanka poems  are  close  cousins  of  the  famous  sparse Japanese haiku. Instead  of being  a poem  of seventeen  syllables  in  lines  of  5-7-5,  the  classical tanka poems consist  of five lines of 5-7-5-7-7  syllables.
3. See  also  Inamasu  (1989),  McClure  (1994,  1998), Yang  et  al.  (1997)  and  Craig (2000).
4. See Hatakeyama  (1990)  and  Ren'ai-kajin  Kenkyuu  kai  (1996).
5. Enka has  been  called  the  country-western  music  of Japan.

7. For  similar  arguments  in  different  contexts,  see  Field  (1989)  and  Harootunian (1989).
8. See Tobin  (1992)  and  McCreery  (2000).
9. As mentioned  before,  most tanka poems  are  not  usually written  in  the  five-line form  that  I have  transcribed  here, but  are written  in  a single  line.
10. Probably the best summary of  J-pop artists and  titles can be found  in  the Japanese Dream Yearbooks (Japanese  Dream,  1999, 2001, 2002).

## CHAPTER  6

1. An earlier version  of this chapter was presented  at the Fifth  Berkeley Women  and Language  Conference,  24-26  April  1998;  portions  were  published  in  their proceedings  (Stanlaw,  1998). I am grateful  to the discussants and  panel  members who contributed  many suggestions  to improve  this work.
2. There  are  three  excellent  translations  of  this  book:  (1)  Arthur  Waley  (1960 [1933]);  (2)  Edward  Seidensticker  (1976);  and  (3)  Royall  Tyler  (2001).  For  a discussion  of the  continuing  influence  of Genji,  as well as resources and  websites, see Kawazoe Fusae, 'Hikaru  Genji's  Next Millennium', Japan  Quarterly, April-June 2000, pp. 31-9.
3. Technically,  there  are at least two kinds of 'ghosts'  in Japanese: yurei, the  frightful remnant  spirit  of  a  dead  person,  and o-bake, a  more  mischievous  and  benign supernatural  creature. O-bake became  popularized  some years ago by the  cartoon character O-Bake no Kyu-chan, while yurei has been  presented  in  numerous kaidan ('ghost  stories' or  'scary tales')  for  hundreds  of years. Most Japanese  do  not  seem to  anthropomorphize  machines  the  way many Americans  do, and  because  they do  not  have souls; machines  such  as computers  probably cannot  be  possessed  by ghosts. However,  among  computer  specialists  there  is such  a thing  as a moji-bake ('character  ghost',  which  transposes  letters). When  something  is prepared  in  a Japanese  word  processing  program  and  then  run  on  an  English  word  processing system,  strange  symbols  and  funny  faces  often  appear  instead  of  normal  SinoJapanese  characters.  These  characters  are  sometimes  believed  to  have  been transformed  into  the moji-bake now on  the  monitor  screen.
4. For other  aspects of Tawara's work, see Stanlaw  (1996a,  2001).

## CHAPTER  7

1. Some sections  of this chapter  have appeared  in Stanlaw  (2000b)  in altered  form.

12. As we have  seen  in  Chapter  1, the  English  loanword manshon ('mansion') does not mean  some stately house  on  a hill; it basically means an apartment,  not  much different  from  an apaato (another word for  apartment). Apaman is a magazine  for those  trying  to  find  housing,  and  lists  those apaato ('apartments')  and manshon ('mansions) currently  available  for  rent.

14. As we have seen in Chapter 2, the sawayaka,  teisuti I  feel Coke! phrase  has been  used in  a  number  of  contexts  and  registers  over  the  past  decade.

## CHAPTER  8

1. Portions  of  this  chapter  were  presented  at  the  92nd  Annual  Meetings  of  the American  Anthropological  Association  and  the  1993 Annual  Meeting  of  the

- Midwest  Council  on Asian  Affairs.  I thank  the participants  for  their  help and comments.
2. As a notational convention  reminder, all Japanese terms are and English  loanwords are  italicized  as  throughout  this  book;  however,  I  have  tried  to  adhere  to capitalization  and other  orthography  as presented  in the original  packaging or product  name as much  as possible.
3. According to Arakawa  (1977: 1432), the English word 'lemonade' came to Japanese through  French  in the late  nineteenth  century.

## CHAPTER  9

1. Portions  of this  chapter  were  first  presented  in  1992 at the National  Science Foundation  (NSF) sponsored  conference,  'Color  Categories  in Thought  and Language'  (Asilomar/Pacific  Grove,  California),  and subsequently  published (Stanlaw  [1997a], although  covering somewhat different  material). I thank  Clyde Hardin and the NSF for their invitation, and the twenty-three participants for their thoughtful  comments  (especially Robert  MacLaury, Paul Kay, Luisa Maffi,  and C. L. Hardin). Much raw data was gathered during my dissertation  research  (Stanlaw, 1987a). For a different  kind  of colour  examination  in Japanese  commercials and advertising, see Haarman  (1989).
2. Other  important  approaches  include  and Hayes  (1972),  Farmer  et al.  (1980), Boynton  and Olson  (1987),  Hilbert  (1987),  Boynton,  MacLaury  and Uchikawa (1989), Hardin  (1988), and Thompson  (1995). Japanese colour terminology  from the psychological/neurological  perspective is discussed in Uchikawa and Boynton (1987).
3. See, for example,  the exchanges  in recent  issues of the American Anthropologist (Saunders  1999, 2000; Hardin  and Maffi  2000; Kay 2000), and Saunders  (1992), Kay and Berlin  (1997), Saunders and van Brakel  (1997), Stanlaw  (1992a,  1993b, 1997c), and Kay and Maffi  (1999).
4. From now on, colour terms in capitals will be used to represent basic colour  terms or categories. I am following the terminological  conventions of my former  teachers Cecil H. Brown  and Stanley Witkowski in these  descriptions  (see Witkowski and Brown,  1977; 1981).
5. I have borrowed from  the title of one of the most significant  books on classification that  has appeared  in recent years  (Lakoff,  1987).
6. This  movement has undergone  several  transformations  and nomenclature  shifts (e.g.  'principles  and parameters',  'government and binding',  'move alpha',  etc.). However,  the basic  philosophical  claims have  remained  unchanged.
7. For more  on colours  in Japanese,  see the references  in Kobayashi  (1974, 1990) or  Stanlaw  (1987a).
8. As I have pointed  out (Stanlaw,  1987a), it is difficult  to do colour  term  studies by using sources such as the Japanese  National  Language  Research  Institute  samples because  they do not always make  distinctions  between  spoken  and written  forms; nor do they always distinguish  a head  noun  (say cha, 'tea')  and a colour (cha-iro, 'tea-coloured',  or  BROWN).
9. As can be seen from  the charts elicited for these two people,  there is a fair  degree of informant  variability between  them. As any colour  fieldworker  will tell you,  this is not unusual. For further  discussions on this issue, see MacLaury  (1997).

## CHAPTER  10

1. Such  research  on Japanese  probably began  with  Bendix  (1966)  and  continues  to this  day.
2. As described  in Chapter  8, when  the non-loanword (ichigo) was used, it was always used  along  with  some  unusual  graphics  as  in  this  example  of Kuriimu Ichigo ('Cream  Strawberry'). These candies have the Japanese being rewritten  in  English and roman letters just below it. This seems to make more of an appeal to familiarity 7 (well-known  strawberries)  than  to  the  newness  or  uniqueness  of  the  food.
3. Researchers  have  argued  in  a  number  of  areas  that  sensations  highly  based  on physiology  can  also  have  a strong  cultural  component  (cf.  MacLaury's  'vantage theory'  [1992,  1995,  1997, 2002]).  For views of  cognitive  anthropologists  similar to mine, but focusing  more  on  sensation, see Keller  (1992)  and  Keller and  Keller (1998).
4. Backhouse  (1994)  has made  a  first  attempt  to  examine  taste  terms  in Japanese; however,  it was based  solely on  data  collected  from  a single  informant,  his  wife. See  Stanlaw  (1995b)  for  other  comments.  For  other  work  on  culture  and  the senses, see  Feld  (1982), T.  Horiuchi  (1990), Dorland  (1993), and  Kohl  (1993).
5. There  are actually three  kinds of measuring cups that can be found  in a Japanese kitchen:  a mejaa kappu ('measuring  cup')  of about  200 cc; a keiryoo kappu (keiryoo being  the  traditional  word  for  'measure')  of  about  180 cc  mainly  used  for  rice; and  an amerikan kappu ('American  cup')  of about  250 cc.
6. The Takenoko-zoku was  a  fad  popular  in  the  1980s  and  1990s. Young  Japanese adolescents  would  dress  up  in  odd,  colourful,  pajama-like  frilly  costumes,  wear heavy make-up, and dance to classic soft popular  music, disco, or old ABBA songs (often  a perennial  favourite  for  some  reason). They  often  danced  in  the  instant parks  that were  created  on  Sundays  by closing streets  in  popular  shopping  areas like  Harajuku  in Tokyo.
7. See  MacLaury  (1995)  for  his  different  interpretation  of  my  'purple'  data  using vantage  theory.
8. The  claims  for  the  loanword  'purple'  being  foolish  or  silly  are  based  on  data gathered  from  semantic  differential  scales  I administered  when  conducting  my dissertation  research  (Stanlaw, 1987; see Chapter 9 for a breakdown  of  informants). The semantic differential  (Osgood,  1963; Osgood, May and  Miron,  1975a;  1975b) is a  technique  used  to infer  emotional  response  or  connotation  of informants  by asking  them  to judge  a  term  along  a  scale  of  bipolar  adjectives.  For  example, English  speakers might be asked  to rate,the  'hotness'  or  'coldness'  of  'blue'  on  a scale from  1 to  7. Osgood,  Suci and  Tannenbaum  (1957)  have found  that  almost every word  in  a  language  has  the  power  to  sway informants  in  very  consistent directions, even when  the concept/term  being tested has no apparent  connection to  the  adjective-pair  scale. One  test conduced  in  this study was to rate paapuru as either  being rikoo-na ('clever')  or baka-na ('foolish'),  on  a  scale  from 1 to  7. Informants  in  aggregate  rated  it a  '4'; Japanese  women,  however, were  especially opinionated,  giving paapuru almost  a  '6'  on  a  7-point  scale.
9. Regarding  sex and  its spellings,  there  was a  girl's  guide  to  growing  up  and  sex called Onna  no ko no esu ii  ekkusu ('A  Girl's  S.  E.  X.')  in  the  1970s  and  1980s. Presumably by writing the word  'sex'  out  in katakana, it was less embarrassing  for her  to buy or  be  seen  reading.

10. Zee  (1990), for example, describes the connections between  taste and vision in his discussion  of food  and  the Chinese writing system.

## CHAPTER  11

1. Portions of this chapter were presented at the  1999 Annual Meetings of the Central States  Anthropological  Association  Meetings,  and  in  1991  at  the  90th  Annual Meetings of the American Anthropological Association; parts were also  published in Japanese  in  Stanlaw  (1995a).
2. For further  discussions of the  Boas and  the  Boas Problem,  and  its implications  for linguistics and  anthropology, see Darnell  (1999)  and Valentine and Darnell  (1999).
3. Some exceptions include  the colourful  Lafcadio  Hearn, an American  author  who arrived  in Japan  in  the  1890s. He  married  a Japanese  woman  and  took  the  name Koizumi Yakumo  (Colt,  1990). He was the author of some dozen  books  explaining Japan  to  the West. He was probably one  of the first Westerners  to ever become  a citizen  of Japan,  an  accomplishment  still  rather  difficult  to  do.
4. These  people  are  not  the  only ones. For example, Japanese  Brazilians  today, who largely  still  speak Japanese  as a  first  language  (Higa,  1982; Adachi,  1997;  1999; 2000; 2001), complain about the extensive use of English  (rather than  Portuguese) loanwords.  Many of  these  borrowed  items  are  not  easy for  them  to  understand, nor  are  they  natural  for  them  to  pronounce,  given  how  different  Portuguese phonology is from  English. For instance, the English loanword paaku ('pack')  tends to  be  pronounced  as paaki in Japanese-Brazilian Japanese,  causing  problems  for Japanese  speakers when  they are  in Japan  (Adachi, personal  communication).
5. There  is  no  doubt  that  many  still  argue  over  the  origins  of Japanese,  and  its connections to the rest of the world's languages. For example, Shibatani Masayoshi, in  his  excellent  popular  overview  of  the Japanese  language  for  linguists  in  the famous  Cambridge  Language  Series, states  that  ' [I] ndeed, Japanese  is the  only major  world  language  whose  genetic  affiliation  to  other  languages  or  language families  has  not  been  conclusively  proven' (1990:  94).  However,  it  must  be mentioned  that  scholars  such  as Tsunoda,  Suzuki, and  Kindaichi  overstate  their case and  are  not  representative  of all Japanese  linguists. For  example,  as early as the  1950s, Murayama Shichiroo  (e.g. 1972) and Oono Susumu  (Oono  1957; Ohno 1970)  argued  for  an  Austronesian  or  Uralic-Altaic  connection,  and  many  others concur  showing  that Japanese  shares similarities with  Turkish,  Mongolian,  many Manchurian  and  Siberian  languages,  as  well  as  Korean (for  some  of  these arguments  in English, see Ohno,  1970). Western  linguists, too, for  the  most  part, agree  (e.g. Benedict,  1990; Miller,  1971; 1980).
6. These  just  say no'  books  have  now become  popular  on  both  sides of  the  Pacific Ocean. For example, Nakagawa Susumu  (1991) wrote 'No'to ieru bijinesuman ('The Businessman Who Can Say No')  regarding rebellion  in the ranks against overwork and  total  commitment  to  the  company.  'Businessman',  of  course,  refers  to  the famous saraiiman ('salaried  man  or  white-collar  office  worker')  described  in Chapter  2; the  business  here  is not  devotion  to  the  employees  but  concern  for the poor exploited office  drone. Danziger  (1993)  titled his book of vignettes  about his  life  as a  transplanted  American  in Japan, The American Who Couldn't Say Noh. Presumably,  both  the  pun  on  these  book  titles  and  the  classical  drama  are intended.

## CHAPTER  12

1. Newsweek 15 November  1982, p.  1; articles  on  pages  32 to 38.
2. These  notions  of  'English  as  a  Second  Language'  or  'English  as  a  Foreign Language'  are  theoretically quite  problematic; many argue  that  both  these  terms should  be  replaced  instead  by  'English  as a World  Language'  or  'English  as  an International  Language'. Although  I will  (perhaps  carelessly)  use  all  these  terms interchangeably,  the  reader  needs  to be  aware  of how controversial  (cf.  Kachru, 1990), or  even  schizophrenic  (Kachru  1977), they actually  are.
3. Of  course,  who  or  what  a  'native  speaker'  is, is very  problematic  (cf.  Paikeday, 1985).  I will  ignore  most  of  these  nuances  here,  but  remind  readers  that  such questions  are  actually very subtle  and  profound.
4. As the  name  of the  department  at the  University of Illinois calls itself.
5. English  is taught  in  the  school  system  in  these  countries  as a compulsory  de  facto additional  language. That  is, English  is taught as a foreign language  rather  than  as a second language  (as in, say, Nigeria  or  Singapore).
6. For a listing, with telephone  numbers and addresses, of almost four  dozen  of these organizations,  see Tanaka  and  Tanaka  (1995).
7. Again,  Pride  (1982), Bailey and  Gorlach  (1983), Greenbaum  (1985), Quirk  and Widdowson  (1985), Viereck and  Bald  (1986), Smith  (1983a,  1983b, 1987), Garcia and  Otheguy  (1989),  Cheshire  (1991), Kachru  (1992), and  Smith  and  Forman (1997).
8. As of  2002, the  Ministry of Education  has stopped  authorizing  the  STEP  test.
9. An important  caveat needs  to be  made  about  this  figure:  I am  not  counting  the number of Koreans living in Japan - about 657,000 at the time of this  comparison (Keizai Koho Center,  1997). The  reason  for  this is that most of these  Koreans  are permanent  residents. This can  be seen  from  the  relative  stability of  the  numbers over  time  (e.g. 657,000  in  1996 compared  to 664,000 in  1980).
10. This  history of English-language  newspapers  in Japan  is itself a fascinating  story. S. Tanaka  (1995)  gives a nice  account,  in  English,  from  their  start  as early  trade papers  in  the  1860s to a modern  internationalizing  force  in  the  1990s.
11. It  should  also  be  noted  that  most  of  these  readers  must  not  be  native  English speakers: only 66,000 foreign  residents in Japan  at that  time  came from  the  USA, the  UK, Canada, Australia,  New Zealand,  or  other  'inner  circle'  country.
12. These  articles  are  Stanlaw  (1987b),  Hayashi  (1988),  Hino  (1988), Atkins  and Tanaka  (1990), Fukushima  (1990), Locastro  (1990), Takashi  (1990), Ono  (1992), Nagashima  (1993),  Iwasaki  (1994),  Chiba,  Matsuura  and  Yamamoto  (1995), Connor-Lifton  (1995), Hayashi and Hayashi  (1995), Ike  (1995), Kay (1995), Koike and Tanaka  (1995), Morrow  (1995), Murata  (1995), Nishimura  (1995), Nishiyama (1995), Tanaka and Tanaka  (1995), and  Matsuura, Chiba and  Fujieda  (1999).  (A twenty-four  article  might  be  included  if we  count  Geist  [1991]  who  examined English  in  non-Western  film.)  It should  be  noted,  however,  that fourteen  of  these articles  came  from  a special  issue  in  1995, and  four  came  from  a special  section of one  volume  in  1990.
13. The  term nido by itself  seems  to  imply nido de amor , depending  on  the  context: the  phrase el nido (de amor) is Spanish  and il nido (d'amor) is  Italian.

## APPENDIX

1. Actually,  when  the  50-sound  chart  in  Figure  A.l  was  traditionally  written  in Japanese,  the  five dan, or  vowel  columns,  were  written  as  the  rows;  the  10 consonants, gyoo, were  written  as  the  columns.  In  the  tables  I have  given  here, I have  transposed  the  rows and  columns  for  readability  so they would  on  fit  on  an 8  1/2  inches  x  11 inches  page. Also, as Japanese  is traditionally  read  from  right to left,  the order  of the syllabary columns would of course be in that order as well.

In  Figure A. 1 there  are some unfilled  boxes in  this grid due  to sound  changes over time, and  some original gaps. Also, in a few places, the predicted  consonant + vowel  combination  is not  what  we  might  expect:  e.g.  / s /  + / i /  giving  / s h i / instead  of  / s i / ;  / t / + / u / giving  / t s u / instead  of  / t u / ;  / t / + / i /  giving  / c h i / instead  o f / t i / .  There  are  technical  reasons  for  this phonological  pattern  which will  not  be  discussed  here  (cf.  Tsujimura,  1996,  1999 for  further  details).

2. Actually  the  relationships  between  the  h-,  p-, and  b-sounds  are  rather  more complicated  than  implied  here. First, orthographically,  these three sets of symbols in  the  syllabary  table  are  odd  compared  to  the  others  in  the  traditional  chart. Usually voiceless sounds are unmodified  glyphs and  their voiced  equivalents  have the daku-on quote-mark  diacritic  attached  the  original  symbol  (e.g., ka  fr versus ga tfi  ) . Thus, we would  expect that the voiceless pa syllable would be written  as  (i and  its voiced  equivalent ba as ii . However,  this  is not  the  case. The  symbol  (i represents  the ha syllable  (while pa is written  [ j :  ), indicating  that  all  these  sounds must  have  been  historically  related  (cf.  Shibatani,  1990:  166).  Many Japanese linguists  believe  that  h-sounds  developed  historically  from  p-sounds  through  a process sometimes known as 'weakening of labiality'  (Shibatani,  1990: 167).  That is,  original  p-sounds  in  Old Japanese  become  voiceless  bilabial  fricatives,  which in  turn  become  h-sounds  (see Miller,  1967:191-93; McCawley,  1968)
3. Three  comments  must be  made  concerning  these  palatalized  sounds. First,  note that  a word  like kiya is written  as ki plus ya  ( ^-y 3 )  while  the  palatalized kya is written  with ki plus  the  little ya  ( c f " - \ * &gt;  ).  These  are  two  very  distinct  things  in Japanese. Second, note  that voiced palatal sounds are just  the voiced symbols plus the small y-sounds. For example, gya is written  as i?^&gt;; that is, the  symbol gi plus a small ya. Finally, note  that  the ways that some  of these  consonants  are  romanized are  slightly  different  from  what  we  might  anticipate  following  the  rule  just mentioned  above. That  is, the  table  gives sha instead  of shya or sya (i.e.  / s - /  plus a small /ya/)  as we would expect. This is an artifact  of the particular  romanization system  used;  this problem  will be  discussed  later.

4.

- Two comments  need  to be  made. First,  in  this  table  (Figure  A.3),  due  to  space constraints,  I moved  certain  symbols away from  their  traditional  places: I  placed the  syllabic-n  symbol  to  the  far  right  of the  n-row, and  made  special  columns  for the -ya, -yu, and -yo palatals.

Second, vowel length is actually phonemic in Japanese. For example, the  short initial  vowel  in ie ('house')  distinguishes  its longer  counterpart He ('no').  There are a number of ways that vowel length is indicated in the kana, and both hiragana and katakana denote it differentiy.  In the katakana, vowel length  is simply indicated with a long bar following the syllable to be lengthened. Thus, is is the short syllable shi while the  long shii is written  v-.  In hiragana, because  of  historical  reasons, the  notation  is more complex. For 'a',  'i', and  'u'  sounds, vowel length  is indicated

- by repeating  the vowel symbol again. Thus ki is written  ^ , while kii is written £ O  . Long  'e'  sounds  are  generally  rendered  as ei in hiragana: ^\_IV  Long  'o'  is usually  indicated  by adding  a  'u'  sound:  &amp; 3 .
5. The  extent  of  onomatopoeia  in Japanese  is  quite  remarkable,  and  does  not necessarily carry the  childish  connotations  that  it sometimes  does in  English.  See Kinseido  (1985)  or  Oono  (1988)  for  further  details.
