## Introduction

This book was created out of a desire to fulfill the needs of people who aren't satisfied with their current level of Japanese conversation-speakers who are able to more or less handle day to day conversati 〇 ns, but still want to bring their speaking to the next level by using effective expressions to communicate exactly how they feel.

In this book, we have collected 700 useful phrases that go beyond the standard sayings used in daily life and allow you to precisely convey your thoughts and feelings, in order to enrich your communications with Japa­ nese people. It can be used for practice on both a grammatical a nd functi onal level.

Parts 1 and 2 begin by solidifying the basics of conversation, such as ad­ dressing, greeting, thanking, apologizing, inviting, requesting, and so on. Part 3 helps polish your knowledge of grammar, important in order to ex­ press yourself clearly.

Parts 4 and 5 help you practice being successful in society, covering top­ ics such as shopping, travel, work, hobbies, family, friends, and more. The aim of these chapters is to enable you interact comfortably (confidently) with Japanese people.

To give an example, readers will review basic expressi 〇 ns such as the emergency phrase, "KyCikyCisha 〇 yondekudasai!,z or the phrase for stating their opinion, "Sugoku yokattadesu." As for grammatical knowledge, items such as the usage of "nagara" in "Sumaho 〇 minagara arukuto abunai desuyo"or the" 〜 yd to omou"in "Raigetsu, Kyoto e iko to omotteimasu."will be reviewed. Phrases dealing with situations you will want to master, such as talking about shopping or travel, e.g., "Yama ga suki desu ga, umi ni iketara ureshii desu," have been collected in this book.

The recordings in this book try a new approach, allowing for more effec­ tive practice. The sentence is spoken slowly at first, then again at a natural speed. We have also in eluded easy-to-understand explanations of how to use the phrases, as well as many natural sample sentences that are unlike what you would find in a traditional textbook. We hope you make good use of these resources.

We truly wish for our readers to be able to con fide ntly express them­ selves when communicating in Japanese, and we hope that this book will help you do that.

## How to Proceed with Your Studies

This book is broadly divided into 5 sections:/zFirst steps/Z/Functions/zzzGrammar/^Scenes/and zzTopics.zzThe following steps will help you with your study. Work towards being able to say the Japanese expression correctly and smoothly by practicing it over and over again thoroughly.

## STEP Q Understand the meaning of the phrase

First, get an understanding of the meaning of the phrase, imagine where the conversations are taking place, and understand the in tention of the phrase. The themes in each part and unit will help you learn their content.

## STEP 越 Understand details of the Japanese while listening to the CD

Grasp the unique details of the Japanese sentencesz such as sentence struc­ ture, spoken accents and intonation, while comparing them to the English.

## STEP 目 Say the phrases aloud

The Japanese on the CD is read twice. Once slowly, and once at a natural speed. Try imitating the voice you hear on the CD by saying the phrases aloud immediately after you hear them. Once you become more familiar with them, practice without looking at the book and only listening to the CD.

## STEP Practice through repetition

This textbook only becomes effective when you repeatedly use it to study. Simply listening to the CD will help, but practicing while speaking will be even better. (SeezzHow to Use the CD," p.14)

## How to Use This Book

- Each unit will begin with a description of its theme, along with a simple introduction.
- The CD will begin with a reading of the English sentence.'Try to imagine the situation where it would be said.----------------------
- This indicates an important point, when translating from the English expression to the Japanese expression.-^-----------------------
- This is a hint for saying the phrase in Japanese. It is often the initial word or a key word.

## One Point Advice

- Greetings are extremely important in Japanese culture. So much so that they are graded on the report card at elementary school. Many greetings have multiple mean­ ings, and poor or non-existent English equivalents. 「͓願͍͠·͢」 and 「͢Έ·ͤΜ」 · r Ͷ͕ are just two of these. Listen carefully to find out how many different ways they are used.

- 4  Please help me!

- 5  Please call an ambulance!

- 6  Please call the police!


- □  8 Please stop (that).

- □ 9 Please say that again.



## One Point Advice

- It is said that people tend to avoid saying their opinion clearly and speak ambiguously in Japanese culture. However, it is very important to describe your situation clearly when you are confused or in the case of an emergency.

## ■ Features of the Japanese Spoken Language 1

- ★ The Japanese spoken language is different from the written language in several ways. For example, in the spoken language, one or more sounds are often omittedz or a colloquially contracted form is used. If you can use these, your Japanese will sound more natural.

## 《 Examples of omitted sounds 〉



食΂͍ͯ·͢/͖΂͍ͯΔ


## &lt;Examples of contracted forms&gt;


- 食 If you speak in the polite spoken style using the polite form (Ͱ͢··͢), even if no KEIGO is used, your language will be appropriate. However, we recommend that you use the plain speech style, using the plain form, to your close friends.

## &lt;Examples of polite form and plain form&gt;

| Polite form   | Plain form   |
| 書͖·͢/書͖·ͨ͠    | 書͘/書͍ͨ       |
| 見·͢/見·ͨ͠      | 見Δ/見ͨ        |
| ͠·͢/͠·ͨ͠      | ͢Δ/ͨ͠        |
| 行͖·͔͢/行͖·͔ͨ͠  | 行͘?/行ͬͨ?     |
| 寒͍Ͱ͢/寒͔ͬͨͰ͢   | 寒͍/寒͔ͬͨ      |
| 元気Ͱ͢/元気Ͱͨ͠    | 元気(ͩ)/元気ͩͬͨ  |

Here is an example of a casual conversation in the plain speech style.

「΋͏Ϩϙーτ書͍ͪΌͬͨͷ?早͍Ͷ。」


- в 「͏Μ、早͘遊ͼʹ行͖͍͔ͨΒͶ」
- A/uniFF1A Have you already finished writing your героеt? That was quick!

## One Point Advice

- The phrase 「Ͱ͕͢」 seen in the first example indicates that there is more to the re­ quest that is not being said. For example, "It's a lot of work,""I'm sorry to impose on you and your time,w//l really need help with this." 「Ͱ͢Χ勺 softens the request that is being made and invites the listener to resp 〇 nd positively.

- 「〜͍ͨͰ͢」 can be used to tell someone what you want. However, if you are not comfortable being direct about your wants you can use 「〜ͨΒ͏Ε͍͠Ͱ͢」 or 「ͳΔ ΂͘〜͕͠ゝ͠、Ͱ͢」. In this way you are describing what you want, by saying that you will be happy if your hope comes true.

## Features of the Japanese Spoken Language 2

- ★ In Japanese conversations, the sentence-final particles Ͷ，Α，͔ ͳ, etc. appear frequently.

Ͷ is used when the speaker thinks that the listener also already knows the information that he/she is going to tell the listener. (In a casual conversation between men/ ͳ is sometimes used instead of Ͷ.)

Α is used when the speaker is saying something that he/she thinks the listener does not know yet. Here is an example conversation/uniFF1A

山田「͋、田中͞Μ、髪、切ͬͨΜͰ͢Ͷ。͖ͯ͢Ͱ͢Ͷ。」 ΍·ͩ ͨͳ͔ ͔Έ ͖ 田中「変͡Όͳ͍Ͱ͔͢? 実͸、͜ͷ髪形、気ʹ入Βͳ͍ΜͰ͢Α。切 ͨͳ͔ ΁Μ ͬ͡ ͔Έ͕ͨ ͖ ͍ ͖ Βͳ͍΄͏͕Α͔ͬͨΜ͡Όͳ͍͔ͳ…」

山田「ͦΜͳ͜ͱ、ͳ͍Ͱ͢Α。͘͢͝似合ͬͯ·͢Α。」 ΍·ͩ ʹ͋

Yamada/uniFF1A Oh, Ms. Tanaka, you had haircut, didn*t you? It looks nice.

Tanaka/uniFF1A Isn't 汁 odd? To tell the truth, I don't like this hairstyle. I wonder 讦 having had a haircu t would have been bet ter.

Yamada/uniFF1A I don*t think so. It suits you very well.

As shown in the above example/ ͔ͳ is the marker of a monologue. Therefore, it can be used in conversations in the polite style as well as in the plain style.

- ★ Please note that int 〇 nation is important, too. For example, ͠、͠' Ͱ͢Α with a rising intonation expresses willing consent; but with a falling intonation expresses declining or refusal.
- ★ The Japanese language has lots of homonyms, and a different accent sometimes changes the meaning. For example, the phrase ͖ΐ ͏͔͠' I ͜͠、͖·͢ has the following three meanings depending on the accent/uniFF1A
- 1) Гт going to church.
- 2) Гт going to the meeting today.
- 3) Гт going to buy it today.


## PART3 Grammar


- ★ There is a lot you can say with just this one simple pattern.



- [ ] □1 I am Miller. (My name is Miller.)

- [ ] □ 2 This is Mr. Smith.


- [ ] □ 3 Ms. Smith is my friend.

- □ 7 What is the name of that building?


- [ ] □ 8 Oh, that's Roppongi Hills.

- Aaf are wa

- [ ] □ 9 It's a nice-looking building, isn't it.



## One Point Advice

- When asked a question using the pattern 「〜͸〜Ͱ͔͢」, it is more natural if you do not repeat the subject of the sentence in your reply.
* Kochira wa ~desu. =This is [pers on].
- ★ ~wa (o)genki desu ka? =How is [person]?

- To express cha nge, use 「 V(dicti on ary form) + Α͏ʹͳΔ」. It is often used to describe something you couldn't do, but can now do; or something you can't do, that you used to be able to do. It is often used with potential verbs, sensory verbs and verbs of percepti on.

## ■ Features of the Japanese Spoken Language 3

- ★ The phrase ~ ΜͰ͢ is often heard in Japanese conversations. This phrase represents one of the unique characteristies of the Japanese language. If you use this phrase appropriately, it will convey your feelings nicely, although too much use is strongly discouraged.

## ~ΜͰ͢ is used in the following cases/uniFF1A

- ①  When questioning with a certain premise, or when questioning with a concern or worry.
- ②  When giving a reason or excuse, or when explaining.
- ③  When adding the connotation of emotion or emphasizing the emotion

## For example, please read the following dialogue/uniFF1A

山田「͋Εͭ、ͦͷίーτ、΍ͬͺΓ買ͬͨΜͰ͔͢。」ᶃ ΍·ͩ ͔

田中「͑͑。Ͳ͏ͯ͠΋΄ͯ͘͠、買ͬͪΌͬͨΜͰ͢。」ᶄ ͨͳ͔ ͔

山田「ͦ͏Ͱ͔͢。͋Μͳʹ高͔ͬͨͷʹ、買ͬͨΜͰ͔͢…」ᶅ ΍·ͩ ͔ͨ ͔

Yamada/uniFF1A My goodness! You've bought that coat after all?

Tanaka/uniFF1A Yeah, I really wanted this, and decided to buy 汁 after all.

Yamada/uniFF1A I see. You bought it, despite the fact that it was so expensive...

Without ~ΜͰ͢ in this kind of daily conversation, it sounds somewhat like mechanical robots are talking. If your friend appears in front of you with a bump on his/her forehead, asking Ͳ͏ͨ͠ΜͰ͔͢ʠ will convey your warm feeling of concern better than Ͳ͏͠·͔ͨ͠ which is more like a doc tor's objective inquiry.

- ★  In addition to these, the Japanese language has many other basic sentence patterns that express the speaker's feelings or that indicate concern for the listener, e.g. ~ ͪΌ͏（ͯ ͠·͏ ）,passive verbs, intransitive verbs, and verbs to describe giving and receiving. Each of these forms is explained in the One Point Advice section in this book.

In this case the phrases 「~͸͋Γ·͔͢/͋Γ·ͤΜ͔」、「〜͕΄͍͠Μ Ͱ͕͢」 are very useful because the shop assistant will show you what you need and explain how to take it. Only properly qualified personnel are permitted to sell some drugs.

- Japan has a very sophisticated courier system. You can send skis ahead to your hotel, a suitcase to the airport, or you can just send a gift across town. Packages can be col­ lected from your door, or taken to a local convenienee store or participating shop. If you are out when something is delivered, an "attempted delivery notice" will be left, and the package redelivered, free of charge at your convenience.

## Features of the Japanese Spoken Language 4

The Japanese language has a polite system called KEI&amp;O. Information about KEIGO, 计 s classifications, meanings and forms are described in the One Point Advice section of Part 3, Unit 30. Some learners are not willing to study KEIGO, saying that it is feudalistic. On the other hand, many foreigners admire the manners res, and hotels, etc. The KEIGO that the staff use reflect their hospitality and ensure a very warm welcome to their customers and guests. The use of and service offered in Japanese department si ・〇 KEIGO demonstrates the hospitality of the speaker.

Therefore, in Japanese society, in companies and offices, employees are required to use appropriate KEI60 to people outside their office, and in the new employees* training sessions, new staff are taught how to use KEIGO.

KEIGO expresses not only the vertical relationship but also the distance bet ween people. If you con tinue to use formal, polite KEIGO to your friends, they might feel that you are refusing their attempts to become close to you.

In Japan, the younger students at school use KEIGO when talking to older students, and usually it continues even after graduation or even forever. However, if people get especially intimate, e.g., becoming lovers or business partners, KEIGO is gradually forgot ten and, without noticing it, К ώ IGO is no longer included in their conversations.

- If you listen to the conversations between Japanese people, you may feel that they do not express their emotion very much. But as you study the Japanese language more and more, you will gradually notice that the sentence pattern itself can express the speakers emotion, even when it is not directly expressed.


## PART 5 Topic


- ★ Sports are often broadcast live on television and shown on the news, making them an easy topic of conversation. Try talking about the sports you enjoy.

## One Point Advice

Sport is a popular pastime in Japan. Many people follow their favorite teams, even if they don't play a sport themselves. Sumo has always had a large following and in recent years soccer has grown in popularity. At the junior and senior high school level being a member of the school team can mean practicing after school (and sometimes before) five days a week; plus additional practices and competitionson Saturday, Sundays and during school holidays.

## 形 One Point Advice


Japan has a very good medical system. However, compared to some Western countries, hos­ pital stays may be longer for the same procedure. The number of different pills prescribed for an ailment may also be more than you are used to. This is because often each symptom is treated separately. So there may be a pill for the nose, one for the allergy and another for the cough. Plus one for the stomach, which may be upset by one of the other tablets. If you have any questi 〇 ns about the treatment you are receiving, you should ask until you are well informed. CD-2

## One Point Advice

Japanese people often talk about the weather. So much so that it is often the opening line of a written communication. Just as an English speaker might say "Hi, how are you?" as a way of making conversation, the Japanese will say "It's hot, isn't it?" to which you should resp 〇 nd "Yes, it is"

## J^One Point Advice


Unlike some overseas countries, it is perfectly acceptable to stand and read a book or magazine in a Japanese bookstore. If the bookstore does not want you to do this, they will shrink-wrap the publication in plastic. Comic (manga) books are very popular among people of all ages. You can read stories, learn Japanese, or even study history by just reading manga. With the advent of the smartphone, fewer people are reading paperbacks on the train during their daily commute. But if you look carefully, you will still see the small popular books which have kept commuters entertained for many years. CD-2

## One Point Advice

- When on a trip, you will often find yourself asking or requesting something from some one you are only meeting for the first time. Some people may be rude to you, but many people are kind. Instead of speaking to people in English, try your best to speak as much Japanese as you can, even if you think it may be "poor." Even speaking a string of words, rather than sentences, is okay. Your attempts to speak Japanese will probably earn you a kinder response. CD-2 46
