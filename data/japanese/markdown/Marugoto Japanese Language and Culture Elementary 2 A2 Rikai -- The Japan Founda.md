## Introduction

Welcome to Marugoto: Japanese Language and Culture, a comprehensive series of coursebooks for adult learners of Japanese as a foreign language developed by the Japan Foundation and based on the JF Standard for Japanese Language Education.

The Japan Foundation engages in a variety of cultural exchange initiatives aimed at deepening understanding of Japan overseas and promoting mutual understanding between Japan and other countries. We think it is important that our work, including our work in Japanese language education, takes place in a way that encourages mutual understanding between people in situations where international cultural exchange takes place, and Marugoto: Japanese Language and Culture is based on this way of thinking.

The word Marugoto means 'whole' or 'everything', and was chosen as the title of the coursebook because the course encompasses both language and culture, features communication between people in a range of situations, and allows you to experience a variety of aspects of Japanese culture through hundreds of colourful photographs and illustrations.

The coursebook also incorporates many innovative components for learning language including:

- learning divided into two volumes: Katsudoo (coursebook for communicative language activities), aimed at improving ability in language performance, and Rikai (coursebook for language competences), aimed at improving ability in language knowledge - so that you can choose a method of study that meets your needs and suits your learning style
- designed with an emphasis on understanding and respecting other cultures, and containing situations where people from a variety of cultural backgrounds interact in Japanese
- learning Japanese through listening to a variety of natural contextualized conversations
- management of your own learning through a portfolio approach

We hope that Marugoto: Japanese Language and Culture will motivate you to enjoy learning the Japanese language and Japanese culture, and will help you feel closer to the people who actually live in this culture and speak the language.

## Features of This Book

Marugoto: Japanese Language and Culture is a coursebook that is based on the JF Standard for Japanese Language Education. It has the following features.

## Japanese Levels of JF Standard for Japanese Language Education

Marugoto employs levels that correspond to the six stages of the JF Standard for Japanese Language Education (A1-C2). Marugoto (Elementary2) is A2 level.

## A2 level

- Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment).
- Can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters.
- Can describe in simple terms aspects of his/her background, immediate environment and matters in areas of immediate need.


## Two Marugoto coursebooks: "Katsudoo" and "Rikai"

Marugoto offers two methods of study aimed at enabling you to communicate using Japanese: Katsudoo and Rikai.

Katsudoo: a coursebook for communicative language activities

- For people who want to start using Japanese immediately
- The objective is to gain practical ability communicating in everyday situations.
- You will practise listening to and speaking Japanese a lot.

Rikai: a coursebook for communicative language competences

- For people who want to learn about Japanese
- The objective is to study the features of the Japanese language that are necessary for communication.
- You will systematically study how Japanese is used in communication.

Katsudoo and Rikai should both be seen as main study materials. Decide which to choose based on your learning objectives. In addition, Katsudoo and Rikai use the same topics. If you use both, you can make progress in your overall Japanese proficiency.

## • Intercultural Understanding

Marugoto offers learning in both language and culture. There is help with intercultural understanding in various places, such as the situations of the conversations, contents of the conversations, photographs and illustrations. Learn about Japanese culture, reflect on your own culture and deepen your intercultural understanding.


## Managing Your Own Study

It is very important to evaluate and manage your learning by yourself in order to keep going in language learning. Make a record of the Japanese language and culture you have studied using the portfolio. When you look at the portfolio, you can clearly understand your own learning processes and your accomplishments.

## How to Use This Book

## Course Flow

The Marugoto (Elementary2 A2 Rikai) course is designed with study of communicative language competences, mainly the language structures that underlie communication, at its heart (Japanese script, vocabulary, grammar and sentence patterns). The suggested class length for one lesson is around 120-180 minutes. In the middle and at the end of the course, you will do ' Test and Reflection' 1 and 2.

## Course Example: with a class length of 120 minutes
